<h1>Test Composer Installation Instructions</h1>
<p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Windows 7 (Test Composer has not been tested under other Windows OS) </li>
  <li> Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or greater </li>
  <li><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/">MySQL Community Server</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/SAFSDEV/Core">Software Automation Framework Support (SAFS)</a>* required for test execution</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Test Composer Application</li>
  <ul>
   	<li>Unzip TestComposerInstall.zip??</li>
   	<li>Unzipped contents should contain the following files and folders<br>
			/program files <br>
			0x0409.ini <br>
			setup.exe <br>
			setup.ini <br>
			TestComposer 4.6Standalone.msi <br>
	</li>
	<li>Execute setup.exe or TestComposer 4.6Standalone.msi</li>
	<li>Select location where Test Composer will be installed (Default location is: C:\Program Files (x86)\Test Composer 4)</li>
	<li>Installation should then continue and complete successfully.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Setup</h2>
Note: Before launching Test Composer, please ensure you have installed MySQL Server on your machine (or have a MySQL server available for Test Composer to use)
<ul>
<h3>Launching Test Composer for First Time</h3>
<li>1. Launch Test Composer by double-clicking on "Test Composer 4.6 Standalone" shortcut on the Desktop or selecting from the Start Menu->All Programs->TestComposer->Test Composer 4.6 menu.
<li>2. The "MySQL Database Connection Settings" dialog will appear.<br>
		Fill out dialog with your MySQL server settings.  Here is an example:<br>
	    <strong>Database:</strong> testcomposer  (this value cannot be changed. A testcomposer database will be created on the selected MySQLServer)<br>
	    <strong>Server:</strong> localhost<br>
	    <strong>User ID:</strong> mysqluser  (Note: this user will need access privileges to be able to read/write database and tables to server)<br>
        <strong>Password:</strong> [user password] <br>
	    <strong>Storage Folder:</strong> C:\Test_Composer_Server  (This folder will be the location where all project test cases and application maps are stored)<br>
        Use the "Test Connection" to ensure your settings are set correctly. If a valid server is found, a test will be performed to see if the testcomposer database exists on the server.  If it does not, you will be prompted with a dialog giving you an option to create the database and tables needed by Test Composer to operate properly.
	After connections have been verified (and database and tables created successfully).  Select OK. <br>
 <li>3. Next, the "Setting Configuration" dialog will appear.  Configure how Test Composer will handle test cases when they are executed.
   <ul>
      <li>The "Settings Configuration" dialog should automatically appear upon launching Test Composer the first time.  If it doesn't, please select Admin->Configure from the menu pulldown
	  <li>On the Setting Configution dialog, Select Configuration: {Select a pre-existing name or enter a new name to store your configuration settings.  "Test Composer Default Settings" is filled in by default.}
	  <li>Root Directory for the Automation Project: {Enter path to where you would like Test Composer to compile and build your test cases for execution.}<br>
	     Example:  C:\TestComposer_Automation
	  <li>Script to be used upon Test Execution: {Enter a path to an executable file.  This file will run any time a test case is executed.}
           Use [sAutoprojdir] if you wish to point the current project's path. [sAutoprojdir] will automatically get translated to Root_Directory_of_Automation_Project\Your_Project_Name. For example, if you wish to execute runIBTPackage.bat in your project's path, enter [sAutoprojdir]\runIBTPackage.bat.
           Using the defaults, C:\TestComposer_Automation\SampleProject\runIBTPackage.bat will automatically get executed anytime you execute a test case from the project SampleProject.
           [sAutoprojectdir]\runIBTPackage.bat is set as the default.  Note: the Test Composer default scripts runIBTPackage.bat and runTCPackage.bat are automatically created at runtime if they currently do not exist.
	  <li> Command Line Options for the Script (if Any): {Enter any parameter values if your script accepts command line parameters} - No defaults provided
      <li> Radio Buttons will set default configuration settings<br>
	       Use Image Based Testing Settings: Select if you wish to use SAFS Image Based Testing Settings by default - This radio button is the selected by default.<br>
           Use Test Complete Settings: Select if you wish to use Test Complete default settings<br>
           Note:  Any changes from the default values will unselect the radio buttons.  The radio buttons are used to pre-fill the configuration settings with default values based on the radio button that is selected.
       <li>File Comparator Tool - {Enter path to an application that can compare 2 files.  The application must be able to accept the 2 file names as parameters from the command line.}
     </ul>
   <li>4. Select OK when all settings are completed.  All settings will be saved under the Select Configration combobox name.
</ul>
