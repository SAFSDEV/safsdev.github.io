 MODULE DESCRIPTION:

      Routines and utilities to work on Sheridan Class=SSTree objects in
      Data-Driven Automation.  As of Version 7.5 this control is still found
      as a GenericObject.  TreeView functions like CLICKS etc. will not
      work reliably (or at all) on this Sheridan class of TreeViews.

      However, with the experimental VBInfiltrators available from Rational we
      are able to get a good list of the properties of these objects including
      the Nodes.  Unfortunately, there has been no success in selecting a node
      through the GUI other than by the x,y coordinate relative to the object.
      Thus, while we can verify some state information, can find the index of
      a node by its text; we are still stuck with x,y coordinates to select an
      item through the GUI (without significantly more programming).

      In the App Map, the Tree will be mapped as a child to its window, and the
      Nodes will be mapped as children to the Tree.  The Node names are not
      expected to actually match the text of the actual nodes in the tree.
      Additionally, if a node moves due to expanding or collapsing branches then
      additional named references will be needed for the different coordinates.

      Example:

      [WindowName]
      WindowName="Type=Window;Caption=Main Window"
      TreeLabel="Type=Label;Text=Folder Tree:"
      FolderTree="Type=Generic;Name=folderTree"       &lt;= this is our SSTree

      [FolderTree]
      NodeName1="20,8"            'can work with or without "Coords="
      NodeName2="Coords=20,20"
      NodeName3="Coords=20,35"

      Remember that these x,y coordinate restrictions ONLY apply when trying
      to select, expand, collapse, or otherwise CLICK on one of these nodes.
      We are otherwise able to retrieve node text, indexes, and state information
      through normal methods.

<a name="verifyproperty"></a>
   Sub VerifyProperty ()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to verify the value of a property as a String.  Uses
      <a href="GenericMasterFunctions.htm#GenericVerifyProperty">GenericMasterFunctions:GenericVerifyProperty</a>
      to verify the property.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Case-sensitive name of property to verify
       6      Case-sensitive expected value of property

 ERRORS:

      none

<a name="verifyarrayproperty"></a>
   Sub VerifyArrayProperty ()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to verify the array values of a property as a String.  Uses
      <a href="GenericMasterFunctions.htm#GenericVerifyArrayProperty">GenericMasterFunctions:GenericVerifyArrayProperty</a>
      to verify the array property.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      TBD

<a name="verifytextnodeselection"></a>
  Function  VerifyTextNodeSelection  (nodetext As String)  As Integer

  Description:

      Verifies the currently selected item text matches that provided.

      Failure messages are generated on error, mismatch, or no node selected.
      Warning message generated if more than one node is selected.
      Pass message generated if (first) selected node text matches nodetext.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function including message logging.

      This routine is considered a utility routine for the other Subs in this
      Library.  Thus, the StepDriverTestInfo.statuscode is not modified for
      success or failure by this routine.  That must be done as needed by the
      calling routine.

  Parameters:

      nodetext    Case-sensitive visible text of the node to locate.

  Returns:

      0 if a scripting error occurs, if does not match, or no node is selected.
      1 if it matches (success)

  Errors:

      (none)

   Sub VerifyExpandedState ()


 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to verify the state of the Expanded property--True or False--
      for the node with the provided text.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Case-sensitive text of the node to check.

<a name="dblclicknode"></a>
   Sub DblClickNode ()


 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to DblClick a node according to its AppMap reference.  Because
      the SSTree is unsupported, this reference is the x,y coordinate of a
      GenericObject DblClick command in the form x,y (i.e. "25,10").
      Because of the nature of the reference, we cannot check whether or
      not the node is collapsed/expanded before or after this routine or
      even if we clicked on the right node.  Verify the selection and
      expanded state of the node before and/or after to check.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      the named reference of the coordinates to expand/collapse

 ERRORS:

      the SSTree is unsupported this reference is the x,y coordinate of a
      GenericObject Click command in the form x,y (i.e. "25,10").

<a name="main"></a>
   Sub Main ()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Entry point to process a StepDriver ACTION COMMAND on a Sheridan SSTREE.
      The routine merely reads the Global StepDriverTestInfo.testcommand and
      calls the appropriate subroutine to process it.

      If the testcommand is unrecognized it will log a WARNING_MESSAGE and
      exit with a WARNING status.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      none    -   the called subroutine has the requirements

 ERRORS:

      none

      OCT 22, 2002    (Carl Nagle) Warn of unimplemented TF and TW record types.
