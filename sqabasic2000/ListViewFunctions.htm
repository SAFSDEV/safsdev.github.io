      it needs to perform its function.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Case-sensitive text of node to select

 ERRORS:

<a name="selectindexitem"></a>
   Sub SelectIndexItem (Optional coords)


 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to select (single click) an item according to its index number.

      It is important to note that some ListViews index their values
      differently.  For example, you may need to select an item by
      text by using a property whose starting index is 1 [ex: ListItems(1).Text].
      Yet, if you request to seek an item strictly by index, the starting
      index is 0 [ex: <recmeth>;\;ItemIndex=0].
      So, the test developer may need to evaluate their ListView object for these
      differences.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

      For ...Coords commands:
      The coordinate lookup is done with the component name of the record AND
      Field #6.

      Typical Data Table records:

      (1) t Window MyList ...Coords  "2"  "5,20"
      (2) t Window MyList ...Coords  "2"  "Coords=5,20"
      (3) t Window MyList ...Coords  "2"  "Center"

      #1 contains an example of specifying explicit coordinates to click.

      #2 contains another example of specifying explicit coordinates to click.

      #3 above will contain a "MyList=" entry in the "[Window]" section with
         normal recognition information for it.  "MyList" will also have it's
         own section in the Application Map in which there will be an entry like:

         [Window]
         Window="Type=Window;...."
         MyList="Type=ListView;...."
         ....

         [MyList]
         Center="5,20"
         BottomRight="Coords=10,50"
         ....

         This will tell Robot to locate the MyList object and click at the coordinates
         specified by the reference.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Index of node to select

       6      Coordinates, or App Map reference to coordinates to click.
              Only used for "Coords" Actions that specifically require this parameter.

 ERRORS:

      none

<a name="selectrandomitems"></a>
   Sub SelectRandomItems ()


 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to randomly select (CTRL + single click) multiple items in the list.
              The number of items to select is provided by the user in the ITEMCOUNT parameter.
              Items already selected are NOT unselected first.  We add to items already
              selected.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function. It will attempt to select a number of unique
      items as passed in in field 5.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Quantity of Unique Items to select.

<a name="main"></a>
   Sub Main ()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Entry point to process a StepDriver ACTION COMMAND on a LISTVIEW.
      The routine merely reads the Global StepDriverTestInfo.testcommand and
      calls the appropriate subroutine to process it.

      If the testcommand is unrecognized it will log a WARNING_MESSAGE and
      exit with a WARNING status.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      none    -   the called subroutine has the requirements

 ERRORS:

      none
