<H2>SQABasic "StepDriverStack" Library</H2>
<pre>
 MODULE DESCRIPTION:

 Routines for implementing the StepDriver STACK.

 NOTE:
 SQABasic does not allow an array to be part of a user-defined data type.
 Because of this, a STACK buffer is actually comprised of two things referred
 to as a buffer pairing:

      <a href="BufferUtilities.htm#user_defined">BufferInfo</a> -- tracks pointers for read and
                write and size information.

      Buffer -- array of <a href=StepDriverStack.htm#user_defined">StepDriverStates</a> used as
                the buffer

 These buffer pairings actually get modified separately and care must be taken to
 insure that they remain in sync with each other.  If they do not remain in
 sync then data corruption and unexpected program behavior (or maybe even
 access violations) could result.

 The routines in this library are intended to maintain both parts of the pair.
 See <a href="BufferUtilities.htm">BufferUtilities</a> for more information and routines used here to maintain this STACK.

      (none)

 RETURNS:

      <a href="BufferUtilities.htm#constants">BufferUtilities</a>.BUFFER_INITIALIZED       If buffer appears initialized.
      <a href="BufferUtilities.htm#constants">BufferUtilities</a>.BUFFER_NOT_INITIALIZED  One or more fields has unexpected values (usually 0)

<a name="initstepdriverstack"></a>
  Function InitStepDriverSTACK (size As Integer, inc As Integer) As Integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      Initializes our STACK pairing with the initial size and increment
      value as provided.  The increment value is how much the buffer size
      should be increased each time it is resized.

      On exit, the pairing is initialized and ready for use.

 PARAMETERS:

      size    the size to initially allocate for the STACK buffer.
              If <1 then the default size of 5 will be used.

      inc     the increment value used when increasing the buffer size.
              If <1 then the default inc of 1 will be used.

 RETURNS:

      N           The initialized size of the STACK on exit.

      <a href="BufferUtilities.htm#constants">BufferUtilities</a>.BUFFER_NOT_INITIALIZED   If a problem occurred.

 ERRORS:

       none

 Note:
 SQABasic does not allow an array to be part of a user-defined data type.
 Because of this, a STACK is actually comprised of two things referred to as
 a buffer pairing:

      BufferInfo  tracks pointers for read and write and size information
      Buffer      array of the desired type used as the buffer

 These buffer pairings actually get modified separately and care must be taken to
 insure that they remain in sync with each other.  If they do not remain in
 sync then data corruption and unexpected program behavior (or maybe even
 access violations) could result.

 The routines in this library are meant to fully implement the buffer
 pairings for the user.  Calls to the routines in the BufferUtilities
 library are not necessary and should be avoided.

<a name="pushstepdriverstack"></a>
  Function PushStepDriverSTACK () As Integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      Pushes the current state of StepDriver onto the STACK.

          AUCurrentAppMap

      Then push the copies to the STACK.

 PARAMETERS:

      (none)

 RETURNS:

      N                          new calculated count of items in the buffer.

 PARAMETERS:

      none

 RETURNS:

 PARAMETERS:

      state       a StepDriverState reference to receive the object

 RETURNS:

<a name="getlaststepdriverstate"></a>
  Sub  GetLastStepDriverState (state As StepDriverState)

 DESCRIPTION:

      Retrieves the state of the StepDriver just prior to the last POP.

      However, some routines that re-enter StepDriver will want to get a
      handle on their own separate statistics for reporting or logging
      purposes.  To do this, they must get the statistics before the POP
      or call this routine before the next PUSH.

 PARAMETERS:

      state       a StepDriverState reference to receive the stored state.
                  If there has never been a PUSH or a POP then the returned
                  state will contain uninitialized or default values for fields.

 ERRORS:

       none
