<h3>CRITICAL REMINDERS</h3>
<p>
This release of RRAFS has been a long-time in the making.  The primary focus of this release was to provide NLS testing support within RRAFS and SAFS. A major push to support Selenium as a web testing engine in SAFS was also performed.  If you contributed any RRAFS code to the SAFSDEV project for inclusion in a future release please review the new source before assuming your contributed code is included in this release.
<p><i>
Because of the extensive NLS effort some generous RRAFS contributions by third parties are not in this release.  These contributions are slated for another release later this year (2007).  It is not that we do not appreciate and value these contributions, we simply did not have the time and resources to merge, document, and test them while devoted to the NLS and Selenium efforts.</i>
<p>
<b>Robot Scripts *must* be recompiled.</b><br/>
All existing RRAFS Robot <b><i>scripts</i></b> that reference or INCLUDE any part of
this framework should be recompiled.
<p>
Normally, a quick <i>File->Batch Compile</i> of GUI Scripts within Robot will take
care of this.  You must do this in each project that uses the framework.  If you had
any custom libs that referenced the framework then they too may need to be recompiled
with <i>File->Batch Compile</i> SQABasic Library sources.
<p>
<b>Backup selected <i>customized</i> files before installation!</b><br/>
If you have never installed RRAFS or SAFS before, then this doesn't apply to you.<br/>
If you installed but never modified any of the files, then this doesn't apply to you.&nbsp;
But you may want to review these files "just in case".
<p>
Affected customizable files from previous releases:<br/>
<ul>
<li>RRAFS.INI
<li>RRAFS Custom Extension Libraries
<li>Any modifications in your SAFS install directories &lt; C:\SAFS\bin > batch files
(*.bat, *.vbs, etc.) or any SAFSTID.INI in the root SAFS install directory &lt; C:\SAFS >.
</ul>
<p>
If you have taken advantage of any of the customization capabilities of this framework,
then you must take some simple precautions prior to installing this new release.
Installing a new version of the framework will install new, default (empty) versions of
these files.
<p>
<b>RRAFS.INI</b><br/>
Essentially, you must make a backup of any RRAFS.INI in your Rational install directory
(DDE_RUNTIME) if you have made customizations by modifying settings; then evaluate how
and if you want to merge with the new file.
<p>
<b>Custom Extensions</b><br/>
Backup any Custom Extension libraries in which you have implemented customizations.
Users who have implemented customizations in older versions of those libraries can then
overwrite the newly installed files with those older versions.  This effectively reinserts
your customizations into the new version of the framework.
<p>
<b>SAFSTID.INI</b><br/>
You should make a backup of any SAFSTID.INI in your SAFS install directory (C:\SAFS) if
you have this file and modified settings.  Then evaluate how and if you want to merge
with the new file.
<p>
<b>SAFS Batch Files</b><br/>
If you have previously installed the SAFS Framework separately, then you may have manually
modified batch files or VBS script(s) to handle custom project paths.  You will need to
backup modified files and evaluate how and if you want to merge such changes with the new
files.
<p>
Failure to perform any of these prescribed backups may erase your prior customizations.
Hopefully, you have backed them up somewhere already as part of your normal ongoing
activities.
Right?!

framework. This HTML doc is also provided in your RRAFS install directory.

<h3>New Tools This Release.</h3><br>
<ul>
<li><b>NLS support expanded</b>
<p>
Significant rework was done to better enable RRAFS to support NLS testing.  This includes NLS
testing of multi-byte languages.  For this to be most effective NLS testing should be done with
STAF and the SAFS Framework installed and enabled during testing.
<p>
<li><b>Support for opening test tables encoded in UTF-8</b>
<p>However, Robot has difficulty interpretting any data on the same line as the UTF-8 leader bytes at the top of the file.<br/>
<b>No valid line of execution should exist on the first line of a UTF-8 encoded test table.</b><br/>
If existing multi-byte test tables encoded in another format cause problems, convert these tables to the recommended UTF-8 format.
<p>
<li><b>App Map Chaining</b>
<p>
App Map Chaining allows multiple App Maps to be used in a sequential lookup chain.<br/>
See new <a href="TestDesignGuidelines.htm" alt="TestDesignGuidelines">Test Design Guidelines</a>
for more info.
<p>
<li><b>App Map Variable Resolve</b>
<p>
App Map Resolve of DDVariables inside stored recognition strings.<br/>
See new <a href="TestDesignGuidelines.htm" alt="TestDesignGuidelines">Test Design Guidelines</a>
for more info.
<p>
<li><b>STAF 2.6.11</b>
<p>
Packages released with STAF now contain STAF 2.6.11. &nbsp;This version of STAF supports
Java 1.5.  If you have a lower version of STAF installed you should uninstall it before
installing this new version.  If you have the older version of STAF installed that will still
work just fine.

<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>

<dl><dt>
<b>Review Backup Reminders in <a href="#reminders">Critical Reminders</a></b>
<p><dd>
If you have not done so, review the <a href="#reminders">Critical Reminders</a> concerning
backups of locally modified or customized files from previous releases.  I'd hate to say,
"I told ya so."
<p></dd><dt>
<b>Uninstall Pre-2003.08 RRAFS Releases:</b>
<p><dd>
Installations of RRAFS Release 2003.01.27 (Jan 2003) and earlier installed via the Windows
Installer .MSI need to uninstall that release before installing this new one.  You must do
this to avoid unexpected backward versioning that can occur if the Windows Installer update
or repair feature is ever invoked.
<p>
RRAFS Release 2003.08.27 (Aug 2003) and later do not have this uninstall requirement as we
implemented the ability to patch and install on top of releases using different technologies.
<p>
Uninstall <b>SAFS Engine for Rational Robot</b> from the Windows Control Panel "Add/Remove
Programs" application if present.
<p><dt>
<b>Short-N-Sweet install instructions:</b><br/>
Also reference: <a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/DDEngineSetup.htm"  >
Engine Setup</a>, a copy of which should be available in your install directory.
<p>
Per the Engine Setup doc, a Java JVM and Windows Scripting Host V5.6 or later are required.
Refer to the
<a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/DDEngineSetup.htm#installtools"  >
Engine Setup Tools</a> section for more details and install information for those tools.
<p><dd>
<ol>
<li><b>Extract the Release .ZIP into the RRAFS DDE_RUNTIME directory.</b><br/>
Extract all files of the ZIP file into your
C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Rational\Rational&nbsp;Test\sqabas32 directory (or equivalent...a.k.a.
DDE_RUNTIME).
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>DO NOT Extract using foldernames.</b>  All files extracted into this one directory.
<li><b>Overwrite Existing Files</b> if a previous release exists.
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Run the extracted <b>SetupRRAFS.wsf</b> script.</b><br/>
In Windows Explorer, locate "SetupRRAFS.wsf" in that directory and double-click to execute it.<br/>
<small>(Previously we used Setup.vbs, but this has been deprecated and will simply launch
SetupRRAFS.wsf.)</small>
<p>
<li><b>Setup Rational Robot Playback per DDEngineSetup</b><br/>
Verify/Complete any Robot Playback Options setup per the DDEngineSetup doc mentioned in the
following section.
<p>
<li><b>If desired, setup SAFS and Rational RobotJ/XDE Tester/Functional Tester per
<a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/SetupSAFS.README.htm">SetupSAFS.README</a></b><br/>
Verify/Complete any setup per doc.
</ol>
</dl>
<p>
<b>SetupRRAFS.wsf</b> should take care of all DLL registration and placement required by the
RRAFS Engine.&nbsp; In fact, the Installer even provides compiled Robot code (SBX) into
the DDE_RUNTIME directory so that most users can jump right in without having to compile
the library source.  Users with incompatible versions of the Robot compiler (pre-V2001,
I think) will need to recompile the source for their incompatible version of Robot.
<p>
<b>SetupRRAFS.wsf</b> will also install the MSXSL.EXE utility used for XML\XSL
transformations.  However, the Installer does not install ExamDiff or any other
Diff Viewer to take advantage of that new capability.
(See the Setup doc for more information.)
<p>
(Note: the MSXSL.EXE installed is the pre-msxml4 version.  You may be able to download a
later version from microsoft.com. The latest version from Microsoft purportedly will not
work with pre-msxml4 versions of msxml. (I have not had any problems with it.-- Carl)
<p>
<b>SetupRRAFS.wsf</b> will prompt to confirm for the installation of the SAFS Framework
and STAF.&nbsp; The user has the option to skip these installations by pressing "Cancel"
when prompted.  We recommend you perform the SAFS installation even if you think you might
not use the expanded features.  You can skip the STAF install if STAF is already installed
on the machine from a previous release.<br/>
<b>You should definitely skip the STAF install if you have an older version (2.5.x) of STAF installed.</b>
<p>
<b>SetupRRAFS.wsf</b> will not install any program that will appear in Control Panel's
"Add/Remove Program" application.

<h3>Functional Tester Support Notes</h3>

Currently, there is a large array of Component Function libraries and commands
supporting the testing of Web and Java applications.
<p>
Functional Tester can support all of the Driver Commands made available by the SAFS/DriverCommands
engine.  If SAFS/DriverCommands is not running for some reason, those Driver Commands
will be supported by Functional Tester.
<p>
Keep in mind that the historic usage was for Robot Classic to be the Driver for Functional Tester.&nbsp;
In that scenario, ALL of the Component Functions and Driver Commands already available via Robot
Classic were fully supported in addition to those of Functional Tester.  Functional Tester provides some overlap
for these commands, but it also provides some new commands not available in Robot Classic.
This actually means that development of new commands or features can be developed in either
Robot Classic or Functional Tester--whichever is more comfortable to the developer.
<p>
A separate Java-based SAFSDRIVER has been developed that can run tests and drive any SAFS
Engine including Functional Tester.  This driver can be used in place of Robot Classic but does not
yet provide ALL the functionality and Driver Command support provided by Rational Robot.&nbsp;

<h3>Additional Comments</h3>

Some comments about ongoing development...
<p>
Releasing the enhanced SAFS framework does not jeapardize your existing non-SAFS tests.
Existing tests should still work as they always did.  You do not have to use any of the
new features provided by the SAFS Framework.

<h3>Old Stuff</h3>

<b>Older Notes That Are Still Important and Applicable:</b>
<p>
<b>Clearing App Map Cache and Variable Values:</b>
<p>
We often get reports that "changes to my App Map are not getting picked-up".&nbsp;
It is always a good idea to start your test with a known "clean" state for App Map
entries and Variable values.&nbsp; At or near the top of your test script, is a good
place to put the following 2 functions:
<p><pre>
   ...
   <code>DDGClearAppMapCache
   DDVClearAllVariables</code>
   ...
</pre>
<b>Important XML Logging Information For Older Scripts:</b>
<p>
The addition of XML Logging in 2002 will impact older scripts whose LogFacility
(usually MainLog) is initialized enabling all logs with <code>MAX_LOGMODE</code>.
A script enabling individual logs with values like <code>TEXTLOG_ENABLED,
SQALOG_ENABLED, CONSOLE_ENABLED</code>, or any combination of these should not
be affected.
<p>
The issue is that <code>MAX_LOGMODE</code> will automatically enable the new XML Log.
However, the older script will not have one or more other function calls to
effectively handle that XML log once the test is complete.
<p>
For example, older scripts will likely close the logs enabled with <code>MAX_LOGMODE</code>
via the <code><b>CloseTextLogs</b></code> function.&nbsp;  But
<b><code>CloseTextLogs</code></b> does not close XML logs.&nbsp;  The new "close
everything" function needs to be <b><code>CloseAllLogs</code>.</b>
<p>
To retain existing log behavior in older scripts with the smallest script modification
would be to <b>replace</b> each instance of <code>MAX_LOGMODE</code> in these scripts
<b>with</b> the binary equivalent that does NOT include the new XML logging:
<p><pre>

   <b><code>(TEXTLOG_ENABLED OR SQALOG_ENABLED OR CONSOLE_ENABLED)</code></b>

</pre>
No other script modification should be required.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Q: So, what happens if I don't make this change in my scripts and the XML logs
are enabled by MAX_LOGMODE?</b>
<p>
<dd>Your script should function just fine as it always did.  However, the framework
will enable a default XML log for each test run.  At the end of each test run, the log
may remain open unless your script performs a "Reset" subroutine call.  The log will
also likely close when Robot is shutdown or other times that Robot would try to
shutdown its File IO.
<p>
However, the RRAFS framework logging has always been done in APPEND mode.  Each new
RRAFS test run APPENDS to any log of the same name that was not renamed or deleted
prior to initializing the Log Facility.  Since your older script does not know about
the new XML log being created, it will not attempt to delete the XML log from previous
runs.  Thus, you will be growing a nice, large XML log history of every test run by
all scripts that launched a test using MAX_LOGMODE.
<p>
<dt><b>Q: How can I modify my older scripts to *properly* take advantage of this new
XML logging?</b>
<p>
<dd>Folks do different things in their scripts to initialize the logs and run the tests.
I can't possibly address all possibilities here.  However, some general guidelines for
modifying existing scripts are below.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Provide a unique XML log name just as with the Text log.
<li>Delete the previous XML log just as you do the Text log.
<li>CloseALLLogs instead of only CloseTextLogs
<li>"Cap" the XML log with appropriate HEADERS and FOOTERS.
</ol>
</dl>
<p>
<b>Example modified Robot script code including all XML handling:</b>
<code><pre>
    ....
    'clear cached maps and variables
    DDGClearAppMapCache
    DDVClearAllVariables

    'setup lognames, delete previous logs, initialize new logs
    MainLog.logid = "MyImportantTestLog"
    logfile = GetDDELogsDirectory() & MainLog.logid
    on error resume next
    kill logfile &".txt"
    kill logfile &".xml"
    on error goto 0

    'caution, resource intensive and new log formats automatically enabled
    InitLogFacility MAX_LOGMODE, MainLog

    &lt;... any other script code and running the test ...>

    'close the logs
    CloseAllLogs MainLog, 1
    LUCapXMLLog Mainlog.xmllog
    Reset

    'view the text log at the end of the test
    StartApplication "notepad.exe "& MainLog.textlog

    ....
