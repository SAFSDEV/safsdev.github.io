<a name="performaction"></a>
   Sub PerformAction (EXPAND_ACTION, Optional mode, Optional location)


 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to expand a node according to its text value.
      Parent-child relationships are separated with "->"

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 PARAMETERS:

      mode        Optional parameter indicating node text match method.
                  0 for exact match. 1 for partial match. Default is 0.

      location    Location for the mouse click. Ignored for EXPAND_ACTION.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Case-sensitive text of node to expand.
              Parent-child relationships are separated with "->"
              Example: "My New Parent->My Stepchild"

              For "...Partial" commands:
              ------------------------------
              TextValue is the case-insensitive text of the node to expand.
              For each level, a text comparison is performed. If the node
              contains the requested substring anywhere in its text, then
              that node is considered a match.
              Example: "parent->child"  will successfully identify the node
                       "My New Parent->My Stepchild"

 ERRORS:

      none
