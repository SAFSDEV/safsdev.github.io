 MODULE DESCRIPTION:

      Routines to work with data bases via DDE ComponentFunctions.
      These are not normally called directly.  These are called by the DDE
      as it processes DDE test tables containing commands for database functions.

      This functions connects to a data base through ODBC, so you have to have a data source
      pointing to that data base defined, using the appropriate driver.

      They uses SQABasic SQLRequest function to connect, using a basic connection string,
      concatenating the values of 'datasource', 'user' and 'password' parameters. If you
      need a more complex connection string, you have to specify it in the data source (this
      will be implemented in future versions).

      To use Database utilities outside of the DDE, use and consult the
      documentation on <a href="DatabaseUtilities.htm">DatabaseUtilities.</a>

   Sub VerifyDBValue ()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Verifies the case-sensitive value of a table field from a data base.

      To return the value, it executes a SQL query sentence using an ODBC
      data source to connect to the data base.

      A table and field name are required. You also have to specify data source name,
      and optionally user id and password (this is because some drivers
      don't need a user/password).

      To do: if user id and/or password are not specified, don't include
      them in the connection string. This would allow the possibility
      to specify them in the data source definition.

      If the query returns more than one record, the returned value
      is the corresponding to the first one, unless the field name
      be something like COUNT(*) or SUM(InvoiceTot).

      A query condition can be included, usually it is. It can be any
      valid expression allowed by the WHERE clause of the SELECT sentence of the SQL driver
      you are using. For example: "CliBal > 100000 and CliCat = 'C'"

<a name="verifydbnullvalue"></a>
   Sub VerifyDBNULLValue ()

      Verifies if the value of a table field from a data base is NULL.

      Sometimes you have to check if a field's value is NULL. This
      NULL value is different from any other (even zero for numerics
      and null string for characters), so if you try to check it
      using VerifyDBValue() function, if will fail.

      A table and field name are required. You also have to specify data source name,
      and optionally user id and password (this is because some drivers
      don't need a user/password).

      To do: if user id and/or password are not specified, don't include
      them in the connection string. This would allow the possibility
      to specify them in the data source definition.

      This routine will export the contents of a DBTable  to a delimeted file.
      The output file will conatin alternating lines of text, first the row number
      and then the data fetched from that row.  Not sure if this is a great idea,
      but that is how it works for now.

      To do: if user id and/or password are not specified, don't include
      them in the connection string. This would allow the possibility
      to specify them in the data source definition.  If no output directory is specified,
      the result file get saved under "Datapool\Test\".

      a horizontal tab is used to delimit fields.
