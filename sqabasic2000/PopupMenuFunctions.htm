 MODULE DESCRIPTION:

      Since POPUP menus for ALL component types are handled generically by the
      operating system they are mostly handled by the <a href="GenericMasterFunctions.htm">GenericMasterFunctions</a>.

      All of these routines expect a popup menu to be active for the call.

   Sub SelectPopupMenuItem()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Attempts to select a particular text string menuitem in the currently
      active popup menu.  The menuitem should be specified in the form
      "Menu->Menu->MenuItem   CTRL+V" with the full text, spaces(if any), and
      keyboard shortcut text (if any).

      Ampersands preceding underlined characters are optional.
      The routine first verifies that the specified menuitem exists
      and exits with error if it does not.
      If it does exist then the selection proceeds using the MenuID retrieved
      from the found menuitem.

      The routine expects that the popup menu is currently active and can be
      found by the <a href="MenuUtilities.htm#MUGetActivePopupMenu">MenuUtilities.MUGetActivePopupMenu</a> function.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Menu->MenuItem hierarchy string to identify which menuitem to select.

              NOTE:SQA can only handle submenus up to 5 levels deep.


 ERRORS:

      none

<a name="selectunverifiedpopupmenuitem"></a>
   Sub SelectUnverifiedPopupMenuItem()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Attempts to select a particular text string menuitem in the currently
      active popup menu.  The menuitem should be specified in the form
      "Menu->Menu->MenuItem   CTRL+V" with the full text, spaces(if any), and
      keyboard shortcut text (if any).

      Ampersands preceding underlined characters are optional.
      The routine does no verification prior to attempting the click
      or following the click.  This may cause a Rational error if the
      popup menu does not exist or the menu item does not exist

      The routine expects that the popup menu is currently active and can be
      found by the <a href="MenuUtilities.htm#MUGetActivePopupMenu">MenuUtilities.MUGetActivePopupMenu</a> function.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

   Sub SelectPopupMenuID()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Attempts to select a particular menuitem by menuID in the currently
      active popup menu.  This is generally used when the menuitem is a bitmap
      or other item that does not have text.  This value can be retrieved from
      the the menu by index or by manual lookup from a menu structure output
      from MenuUtilities.
      The routine first verifies that the specified menuitem exists and exits
      with error if it does not.  If it does exist then the selection proceeds.

      The routine expects that the popup menu is currently active and can be

<a name="verifypopupmenuitem"></a>
   Sub VerifyPopupMenuItem()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Verify the state of a popup menuItem identified by its text in the
      active popup menu.  The menuitem should be specified in the form
      "Menu->Menu->MenuItem   CTRL+V" with the full text, spaces(if any), and
      keyboard shortcut text (if any).

      Ampersands preceding underlined characters are optional.
      The routine first verifies that the specified menuitem exists
      and exits with error if it does not.

      This command also supports the "TF"(expected failure) record type.
      This command does not support the "TW" record type.

      The routine uses <a href="GenericMasterFunctions.htm#GenericVerifyMenuItem">GenericVerifyMenuItem</a> from GenericMasterFunctions.

      The routine expects that the popup menu is currently active and can be
      found by the <a href="MenuUtilities.htm#MUGetActivePopupMenu">MenuUtilities.MUGetActivePopupMenu</a> function.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Menu->MenuItem hierarchy string to identify which menuitem to test.
              This menu hierarchy IS case-sensitive

       6      Expected status string (or part thereof) to verify.
              Ex: "Enabled Checked"         OR  "Disabled Grayed"    etc.
              Each item separated by a space will be evaluated separately so
              the order of the status items does not matter.
              These status items ARE case-sensitive.

              NOTE:SQA can only handle submenus up to 5 levels deep.

 DESCRIPTION:

 DESCRIPTION:

      Attempts to verify the state information of a particular menuitem
      identified by MenuID in a popup menu.  This is generally used when
      the menuitem is a bitmap or other item that does not have text.

      found by the <a href="MenuUtilities.htm#MUGetActivePopupMenu">MenuUtilities.MUGetActivePopupMenu</a> function.

              (If bench has this descriptive text this field is REQUIRED to pass.)
      [7]     optional name.ext to give current structure in repository's
              Datapool\Test directory for compare with benchmark.
              If no name is given then the bench name is used.
      [8]     optional name.ext to store difference information in repository's Datapool\Dif.
              If no name is given then the bench name is used.

      exit with a WARNING status.
