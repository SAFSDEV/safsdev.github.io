 Function ExportXLSToFiles (fileXLS As String,
                            Optional dirXLS  As Variant,
                            Optional password As Variant,
                            Optional updateLinks As Variant,
                            Optional dirOUT As Variant,
                            Optional delimiter As Variant,
                            Optional colmax As Variant) As Integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine outputs each worksheet within an Excel workbook to a delimited
      file.  In general, this is used to export the data in Excel Spreadsheets
      for processing by other programs (like the Data Driven Engine).

      The XLS file will be open with the updateLinks provided or it will use
      the value of 0 or FALSE to forego any link updates.  In the latter event,
      any linked data that needs to be updated in the Excel workbook should be
      done prior to the call of this routine.

      The XLS file will be opened in READ-ONLY mode.  However, if updateLinks
      is provided and causes an update to occur we will continue but WILL NOT
      save these changes to file.  The updates will be reflected in our
      output files but will not be retained in the Excel file.  Thus, if the
      update is to be retained in the Excel file that will need to be done
      separately.

      If the workbook requires a password then it should be provided as well.

      The routine exports only the range of cells identified by the UsedRange
      Object retrieved from each worksheet.  Each field is extracted by the
      Value returned from the UsedRange.Rows(r).Columns(c).Value function.
      Fields are delimited by the first character in the provided delimiter
      string or by a TAB character if delimiter is not provided.
      Each row is output on a separate line in the output file.

      Each worksheet is output to a separate file.  The name of the file is
      the value returned from the Worksheet.Name property of the worksheet. Thus,
      the worksheet should have a name.ext syntax.  Otherwise you may get a
      file with no extension.  The file will be written to the directory
      specified by the dirOUT parameter or to the dirXLS directory if dirOUT is
      not provided.

      SPECIAL CASE PROCESSING:
      Any worksheet name ending in ".MAP" (case-insensitive) will be processed
      as if it contains Application Map information for the Data Driven Engine.
      This essentially limits the UsedRange processing and output to Column 1
      only.  This is provided for workbooks which include one or more worksheets
      of Application Map data.  These worksheets are still output as separate
      files just like the rest of the worksheets in the workbook.


 PARAMETERS:

      fileXLS     The Excel XLS workbook file to open in dirXLS.  If the .XLS
                  extension is not provided then we will add it. File is open in
                  READ-ONLY mode.

      dirXLS      OPTIONAL directory in which to find the XLS file.
                  If this parameter is not provided then we will attempt to
                  locate the file via <A HREF="FileUtilities.htm#FindSQAFile">FindSQAFile</A> in FileUtilities.

      password    OPTIONAL string password.  If the workbook requires a password
                  then this parameter is NOT optional because Excel will
                  prompt for a password (and we don't like that).

      updateLinks OPTIONAL value to provide when opening the Excel workbook.
                  Normally, Excel prompts the user for Yes or No to update
                  object links if the workbook contains linked objects.  We
                  bypass the prompt by providing this parameter.
                  Valid values you can provide this routine:

                      Numeric 0  to bypass link updates.
                      Numeric 1  to update remote but not external references.
                      Numeric 2  to update external but not remote references.
                      Numeric 3  to update all references.

                  NOTE: Updated data will be used, but not saved.


      dirOUT      OPTIONAL directory in which to write the output files.  If
                  this is not provided then we will output to the same directory
                  found via the dirXLS parameter.

      delimiter   OPTIONAL string containing the field separator character used
                  between fields in a row.  Only the first character is used.
                  If this is not provided then the delimiter will be a TAB
                  character.

      colmax      OPTIONAL Integer containing the maximum number of column has to export.
                  This to prevent that if the Excel file were generated by TESTGENERATOR
                  then the number of column is infinite and the export of the Excel file
                  in textual file is very long. (ADDED By Catherine verbeeck 28/02/2005)

       0  Success

      -1  Missing fileXLS Input Parameter
      -2  Invalid dirXLS, fileXLS, or dirOUT Input Parameters
      -3  Invalid updateLinks value provided

 Function ExportXLS2INIFile  (fileXLS As String,
                              fileOUT  As String,
                              Optional dirXLS  As Variant,

                              Optional dirOUT As Variant) As Integer


 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine outputs all the worksheet(s) within an Excel workbook to one
      "=" delimited file--but with some special handling.

      This is used to export the data in Excel Spreadsheets to a text file
      that is in an INI file format.  In this case, this function is ideal
      for processing an Excel workbook which potentially contains a separate
      worksheet for separate Sections of an INI file or Application Map.
      However, there may be other uses for this functionality.

      The expected format for data in the Worksheet is as follows:

      COLUMN1             COLUMN2
      ==================  ==================

      [SectionName]

      ItemName            ItemValue
      ItemName            ItemValue
      ItemName            ItemValue


      The output file will then look like:

      [SectionName]

      ItemName=ItemValue
      ItemName=ItemValue
      ItemName=ItemValue


      The XLS file will be open with the UpdateLinks provided or it will use
      the value of 0 or FALSE to forego any link updates.  In the latter event,
      any linked data that needs to be updated in the Excel workbook should be
      done prior to the call of this routine.

      The XLS file will be opened in READ-ONLY mode.  However, if updateLinks
      is provided and causes an update to occur we will continue but WILL NOT
      save these changes in Excel.  The updates will be reflected in our
      output files but will not be retained in the Excel file.  Thus, if the
      update is to be retained in the Excel file that will need to be done
      separately.

      If the workbook requires a password then it should be provided as well.

      The routine exports only cols 1 and 2 of cells identified by the UsedRange
      Object retrieved from each worksheet.  Each field is extracted by the
      Value returned from the UsedRange.Rows(r).Columns(c).Value function.
      Cols 1 and 2 are delimited by an "=" character.  However, no delimiter
      is output for blank cols or between col1 and col2 if col2 is empty.
      Additionally, if col1 is empty but col2 contains a value, then the value
      is prepended with a ";" comment delimiter to insure the comment is
      ignored by INI file processing routines.
      Cols 3-N of UsedRange are not processed.
      Each row is output on a separate line in the output file.

      fileOUT will be written to the directory specified by the dirOUT parameter
      or to the dirXLS directory if dirOUT is not provided.


 PARAMETERS:

      fileXLS     The Excel XLS workbook file to open in dirXLS.  If the .XLS
                  extension is not provided then we will add it. File is open in
                  READ-ONLY mode.

      fileOUT     The exported file to create in the dirOUT (or dirXLS) directory.

      dirXLS      OPTIONAL directory in which to find the XLS file.
                  If this parameter is not provided then we will attempt to
                  locate the file via <A HREF="FileUtilities.htm#FindSQAFile">FindSQAFile</A> in FileUtilities.

      password    OPTIONAL string password.  If the workbook requires a password
                  then this parameter is NOT optional because Excel will
                  prompt for a password (and we don't like that).

      updateLinks OPTIONAL value to provide when opening the Excel workbook.
                  Normally, Excel prompts the user for Yes or No to update
                  object links if the workbook contains linked objects.  We
                  bypass the prompt by providing this parameter.

                      Numeric 2  to update external but not remote references.
                      Numeric 3  to update all references.

                  NOTE: Updated data will be used, but not saved.


      dirOUT      OPTIONAL directory in which to write the output files.  If
                  this is not provided then we will output to the same directory
                  found via the dirXLS parameter.

                                  Optional dirOUT As Variant) As Integer


 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine outputs all the worksheet(s) within an Excel workbook to the file
      format suitable for SAS TestComposer.

      This is used to export the data in Excel Spreadsheets to a text file
      that is in a modified INI file format.  In this case, this function is ideal
      for processing an Excel workbook which potentially contains a separate
      worksheet for separate Sections/Windows of an Application Map.
      However, there may be other uses for this functionality.

      The expected format for data in the Worksheet is as follows:

      COLUMN1             COLUMN2             COLUMN3
      ==================  ==================  ===================

      [SectionName]

      ItemName            ItemValue           ComponentType
      ItemName            ItemValue           ComponentType
      ItemName            ItemValue           ComponentType


      The output file will then look like:

      [SectionName]

      ItemName=ItemValue|%|ComponentType
      ItemName=ItemValue|%|ComponentType
      ItemName=ItemValue|%|ComponentType


      The XLS file will be open with the UpdateLinks provided or it will use
      the value of 0 or FALSE to forego any link updates.  In the latter event,
      any linked data that needs to be updated in the Excel workbook should be
      done prior to the call of this routine.

      The XLS file will be opened in READ-ONLY mode.  However, if updateLinks
      is provided and causes an update to occur we will continue but WILL NOT
      save these changes in Excel.  The updates will be reflected in our
      output files but will not be retained in the Excel file.  Thus, if the
      update is to be retained in the Excel file that will need to be done
      separately.

      If the workbook requires a password then it should be provided as well.

      The routine exports only cols 1, 2 and 3 of cells identified by the UsedRange
      Object retrieved from each worksheet.  Each field is extracted by the
      Value returned from the UsedRange.Rows(r).Columns(c).Value function.
      Cols 1 and 2 are delimited by an "=" character.  Columns 2 and 3 are
      delimited by the 3 character string, "|%|".  However, no delimiter
      is output for blank cols or between col1 and col2 if col2 is empty or
      between columns 2 and 3 if column 3 is empty.

      Additionally, if col1 is empty then only a column delimiter is output.
      Cols 4-N of UsedRange are not processed.
      Each row is output on a separate line in the output file.

      fileOUT will be written to the directory specified by the dirOUT parameter
      or to the dirXLS directory if dirOUT is not provided.


 PARAMETERS:

      fileXLS     The Excel XLS workbook file to open in dirXLS.  If the .XLS
                  extension is not provided then we will add it. File is open in
                  READ-ONLY mode.

      fileOUT     The exported file to create in the dirOUT (or dirXLS) directory.

      dirXLS      OPTIONAL directory in which to find the XLS file.
                  If this parameter is not provided then we will attempt to
                  locate the file via <A HREF="FileUtilities.htm#FindSQAFile">FindSQAFile</A> in FileUtilities.

      password    OPTIONAL string password.  If the workbook requires a password
                  then this parameter is NOT optional because Excel will
                  prompt for a password (and we don't like that).

      updateLinks OPTIONAL value to provide when opening the Excel workbook.
                  Normally, Excel prompts the user for Yes or No to update
                  object links if the workbook contains linked objects.  We
                  bypass the prompt by providing this parameter.
                  Valid values you can provide this routine:

                      Numeric 0  to bypass link updates.
                      Numeric 1  to update remote but not external references.
                      Numeric 2  to update external but not remote references.
                      Numeric 3  to update all references.

                  NOTE: Updated data will be used, but not saved.


      dirOUT      OPTIONAL directory in which to write the output files.  If
                  this is not provided then we will output to the same directory
                  found via the dirXLS parameter.


 RETURNS:

       0  Success

      -2  Invalid dirXLS, fileXLS, or dirOUT Input Parameters
      -3  Invalid updateLinks value provided
