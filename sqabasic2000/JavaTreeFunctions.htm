   Sub PerformAction (EXPAND_ACTION, Optional mode, Optional unverified)


 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to expand a node according to its text value.
      Parent-child relationships are separated with "->"

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Case-sensitive text of node to expand.
              Parent-child relationships are separated with "->"
              Example: "My New Parent->My Stepchild"

              For "...Partial..." text node commands:
              ------------------------------
              TextValue is the case-insensitive text of the node to expand.
              For each level, a text comparison is performed. If the node
              contains the requested substring anywhere in its text, then
              that node is considered a match.
              Example: "parent->child"  will successfully identify the node
                       "My New Parent->My Stepchild"

 ERRORS:

      none

   Sub Main ()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Entry point to process a StepDriver ACTION COMMAND on a JAVATREE.
      The routine merely reads the Global StepDriverTestInfo.testcommand and
      calls the appropriate subroutine to process it.

      If the testcommand is unrecognized it will log a WARNING_MESSAGE and
      exit with a WARNING status.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      none    -   the called subroutine has the requirements

 ERRORS:

      none
