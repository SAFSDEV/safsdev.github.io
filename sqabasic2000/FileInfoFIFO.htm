<H2>SQABasic "FileInfoFIFO" Library</H2>
<pre>
 MODULE DESCRIPTION:

 Routines for implementing FileInfo FIFO storage buffers.

 NOTE:
 SQABasic does not allow an array to be part of a user-defined data type.
 Because of this, a FIFO buffer is actually comprised of two things referred
 to as a buffer pairing:

      <a href="BufferUtilities.htm#user_defined">BufferInfo</a> tracks pointers for read and write and size information
      Buffer array of <a href=FileUtilities.htm#user_defined">FileInfos</a> used as the buffer.

 These buffer pairings actually get modified separately and care must be taken to
 insure that they remain in sync with each other.  If they do not remain in
 sync then data corruption and unexpected program behavior (or maybe even
 access violations) could result.

 The routines in this library are intended to maintain bot items in the
 buffer pairing.  See <a href="BufferUtilities.htm">BufferUtilities</a> for more information
 and routines used here to maintain this FIFO.

 Function IsFileFIFOInit(buffer() As FileInfo, info As BufferInfo) As Integer

 DESCRIPTION:

  Verifies that the FIFO appears to have been initialized.

 PARAMETERS:

      buffer  reference to the buffer array of the buffer pairing.
      info    the paired BufferInfo

 RETURNS:

      <a href="BufferUtilities.htm#constants">BufferUtilities</a>.BUFFER_INITIALIZED       If FIFO appears initialized.
      <a href="BufferUtilities.htm#constants">BufferUtilities</a>.BUFFER_NOT_INITIALIZED  One or more fields has unexpected values (usually 0)

 ERRORS:

   none

  Function InitFileInfoFIFO (buffer() As FileInfo, info As BufferInfo,
                             size   As Integer ,  inc As Integer)
                             As Integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      Creates and returns a FIFO pairing with the initial size and increment
      value as provided.  The pairing is already initialized and ready for
      use.

 PARAMETERS:

      buffer  reference to the buffer array of the buffer pairing.
      info    reference to the buffer info of the buffer pairing.
      size    the size to initially allocate for the FIFO buffer.
      inc     the increment value used when increasing the buffer size.

 RETURNS:

      N           The initialized size of the FIFO buffer on exit.

      <a href="BufferUtilities.htm#constants">BufferUtilities</a>.BUFFER_NOT_INITIALIZED   If a problem occurred.

 ERRORS:

       none

 Note:
 SQABasic does not allow an array to be part of a user-defined data type.
 Because of this, a FIFO or STACK or other buffer type is actually comprised
 of two things referred to as a buffer pairing:

      BufferInfo  tracks pointers for read and write and size information
      Buffer      array of the desired type used as the buffer

 These buffer pairings actually get modified separately and care must be taken to
 insure that they remain in sync with each other.  If they do not remain in
 sync then data corruption and unexpected program behavior (or maybe even
 access violations) could result.

 The routines in this library are meant to fully implement the buffer
 pairings for the user.  Calls to the routines in the BufferUtilities
 library are not necessary and should be avoided.

  Function GetFileInfoFIFOSize (buffer() As FileInfo, info as BufferInfo) As Integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      Retrieves the number of items currently stored in the FIFO buffer.
      This routine calculates the number of items based on the current
      values of the reader and writer indices in the provided BufferInfo.
      You CANNOT simply read the value of the info.size field.

 PARAMETERS:

      buffer  reference to the FileInfo array of the buffer pairing to
              optimize.

      info    reference to the BufferInfo part of the buffer pairing to
              optimize

 RETURNS:

      N           The current number of items in the FIFO buffer.

      <a href="BufferUtilities.htm#constants">BufferUtilities</a>.BUFFER_NOT_INITIALIZED   If a problem occurred.

              optimize.

              optimize

 RETURNS:

      <a href="BufferUtilities.htm#constants">BufferUtilities</a>.BUFFER_INITIALIZED       If FIFO is NOT empty.

<a name="optimizefileinfofifo"></a>
  Function OptimizeFileInfoFIFO (buffer() As FileInfo, info As BufferInfo) As Integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      If the FIFO is not already optimized then optimize it.
      This will remove any old entries that have already been read.
      This is the first step in making a FIFO not "FULL".

 PARAMETERS:

      buffer  reference to the FileInfo array of the buffer pairing to
              optimize.

      info    reference to the BufferInfo part of the buffer pairing to
              optimize

 RETURNS:

      N                       The number of items in the buffer.
                              (This number should not change between entry
                               and exit.)

      <a href="BufferUtilities.htm#constants">BufferUtilities</a>.BUFFER_NOT_INITIALIZED   If FIFO appears uninitialized.

<a name="expandfileinfofifo"></a>
  Function ExpandFileInfoFIFO (buffer() As FileInfo, info As BufferInfo) As Integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      Expand the FIFO by the amount stored as the redimIncrement.
      First, the FIFO will be optimized although some routines might have
      already done this for us.  Next the FIFO is redimmed PRESERVing the
      existing contents.

 PARAMETERS:

      buffer  reference to the FileInfo array of the buffer pairing to
              optimize.

      info    reference to the BufferInfo part of the buffer pairing to
              optimize

 RETURNS:

      N               The number of available (unused) items in the buffer.

      <a href="BufferUtilities.htm#constants">BufferUtilities</a>.BUFFER_NOT_INITIALIZED   If FIFO appears uninitialized.

 ERRORS:

       none

      <a href="BufferUtilities.htm#constants">BufferUtilities</a>.BUFFER_IS_FULL     error if FIFO is FULL and fails to be
                                  expanded (which is attempted).
