   Sub VerifyHTMLImage()


 DESCRIPTION:

      Attempts to rightclick and save an HTMLimage and then perform a binary compare
      with a benchmark file.

      This command supports the "TW" record type when the user has configured
      a diff tool for which we have no means to automatically verify the results.
      The command may produce a WARNING if such a tool is configured and used.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

      For records with the optional Coordinate provided:
      The coordinate lookup is done with the component name of the record AND
      the provided reference in Field #6.

      Typical Data Table records:
      ===========================

      (1) t Window MyImage VerifyHTMLImage  ^bench="Image.jpg"

      (2) t Window MyImage VerifyHTMLImage  ^bench="\SomeRelativePath\Image.jpg"  ^rightclick="Coords=5,20"

      (3) t Window MyImage VerifyHTMLImage  ^bench="c:\Image.jpg"  ^rightclick="Center"

      ===========================

      #1 uses default coordinates and a benchmark file in <project>\Datapool\Bench

      #2 uses provided coordinates and a benchmark file stored in a relative path
         found via <a href="FileUtilities.htm#findsqafile">FindSQAFile</a>.

      #3 uses coordinates stored in the App Map in a "Center" entry in the "[MyImage]"
         section like below.  The record also specifies an explicit full path to the
         desired benchmark file.

         [Window]
         Window="Type=Window;...."
         MyImage="Type=HTMLImage;...."
         ....

         [MyImage]
         Center="10,10"
         BottomRight="Coords=18,18"
         ....

         This will tell Robot to locate the MyList object and click at the coordinates
         specified by the reference.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Benchmark filename for binary comparison.

      [6]     Optional coordinates, or App Map reference to coordinates to right click.


 ERRORS:

      none

   Sub SaveHTMLImage()


 DESCRIPTION:

      Attempts to rightclick and save an HTMLimage.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

      Typical Data Table records:
      ===========================

      (1) t Window MyImage SaveHTMLImage ^filename="Image.jpg"
      (2) t Window MyImage SaveHTMLImage ^filename="C:\Image.jpg"  ^xy="25,25"
      (3) t Window MyImage SaveHTMLImage ^filename="images\Image.jpg"  ^xy="TopRight"

      ===========================

      #1 saves the image to the project's Datapool\Test directory.

      #2 saves the image to the explicit path provided. Right click on the image at
         coordinates 25,25 instead of the default coordinates to expose the menu.

      #3 saves the image to the images subdirectory off of the project's
         root directory.  Right click on the image at the coordinates specified in the
         app map under MyImage defined as TopRight.

      Sample App Map:

         [Window]
         Window="Type=Window;...."
         MyImage="Type=HTMLImage;...."
         ....

         [MyImage]
         TopRight="50,10"
         Center="25,25"
         BottomRight="Coords=50,40"
         ....


 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      (Required) Image filename.
              A simple filename with no path info, a filename with relative
              path info, or a full filename path.

      [6]     Optional coordinates, or App Map reference to coordinates to right click.


 ERRORS:

      none

<a name="main"></a>
   Sub Main ()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Entry point to process a StepDriver ACTION COMMAND on a HTMLImage.
      The routine merely reads the Global StepDriverTestInfo.testcommand and
      calls the appropriate subroutine to process it.

      If the testcommand is unrecognized it will log a WARNING_MESSAGE and
      exit with a WARNING status.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      none    -   the called subroutine has the requirements

 ERRORS:

      none
