Remember: "RobotJ", "XDE Tester", and "Functional Tester" are names for the
same IBM Rational test tool as habitually (re)named by IBM Rational.&nbsp; We collectively
refer to all of these as "RobotJ", or simply "RJ" in much of our documentation and class names.
&nbsp;(After all, we can't continuously rework all our documentation and class implementations just
because IBM Rational has an identity problem.)
<p>
<b><font size="5">Backup selected customized files before installation:</font></b><br>
If you have never installed RRAFS or SAFS before, then this doesn't apply to
you.<br>
If you have previously installed but never modified any of the files then this doesn't apply
to you.&nbsp; Still, you may want to review the mentioned files &quot;just in case&quot;. </p>
<p>Affected customizable files from previous releases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>RRAFS.INI </li>
  <li>RRAFS Custom Extension Libraries </li>
  <li>Any modifications in SAFS\bin\ or SAFS\samples batch files (*.bat or *.vbs).</li>
  <li>Any modifications to SAFSTID.INI files in SAFS\</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have taken advantage of any of the customization capabilities of this framework,
then you must take some simple precautions prior to installing this new release.&nbsp;
Installing a new version of the framework will install new, default versions of these
files.&nbsp; Failure to perform any of these prescribed backups may erase your previous
customizations. Hopefully, you have backed them up somewhere already as part of your normal
ongoing activities...You have done this, right?! </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>RRAFS.INI</b><br>
  Nothing was added to RRAFS.INI that is <em>required</em>.
  &nbsp; You can continue to use your old file.</li>
  <p>
  <li><b>Custom Extensions</b><br>
  Backup any Custom Extension libraries in which you have implemented
  customizations. Users who have implemented customizations in older versions of those
  libraries can then overwrite the newly installed files with those older versions. This
  effectively reinserts your customizations into the new version of the framework. Consult
  <a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/UsingCustomExtensions.htm">
  Using Custom Extensions</a> for additional information on Custom Extensions with this
  framework. This HTML doc is also provided in your RRAFS install directory.</li>
  <p>
  <li><b>SAFSTID.INI</b><br/>
  You should make a backup of any SAFSTID.INI in your SAFS install directory (SAFS\) if you
  have this file and modified settings.  Then evaluate how and if you want to merge with the
  new file.
  <p>
  <li><b>SAFS Batch Files</b><br>
  If you have previously installed the SAFS Framework separately--such as when it was offered
  via a supplemental Patch in Oct 2003--then you may have manually modified batch files or
  VBS script(s) to handle custom project paths.  You will need to backup modified files and
  evaluate how and if you want to merge such changes with the new files. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><b><font size="5">Uninstall Pre-2003.08 RRAFS Release: </font></b></p>
<p>
Installations of RRAFS Release 2003.01.27 (Jan 2003) and earlier installed via the Windows
Installer .MSI need to be uninstalled before installing this new release.&nbsp; You must do
this to avoid unexpected backward versioning that can occur if the Windows Installer update or
repair feature is ever invoked. </p>
<p>
RRAFS Release 2003.08.27 (Aug 2003) and later do not have this uninstall
requirement as we implemented the ability to patch and install on top of
releases using different technologies.</p>
<p>
To uninstall these older releases, uninstall "<b>SAFS Engine for Rational Robot</b>" from the
Windows Control Panel &quot;Add/Remove Programs&quot; application if present. </p>
<p>
Future releases of the framework will not have this problem as we will have the ability to
patch and install on top of releases using Scripting technology.  If you manually installed
the engine previously, you should not need to delete your existing installation. Manual
installation and the new Installer will simply overwrite existing files. Instructions for
manually installing the engine are at the end of this document. </p>
<p>
<hr>
<p><b><font size="5">Basic Install Steps if Accepting all Defaults: </font></b>
<p>
<ol>
   <li>(Optional) Check Java and WSH prerequisites
   <li>Download the latest RRAFS Release
   <li>UnZip the Release into your "C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Rational\Rational&nbsp;Test\sqabas32" directory.
   <li>Double-Click&nbsp;"<b>SetupRRAFS.wsf</b>" in that directory.
   <li>Check Robot configuration settings
</ol>
<p><i>Now, on to <b>"why you should read the rest of this first..."</b></i>
<p><font size="4"><b>Install Java Runtime Necessary for SAFS Framework.</b></font></p>
<p>
The additional SAFS installation requires that a Java Runtime Rnvironment (JRE) is already
installed on the target machine. For best results and ease of installation, a JRE version of
1.4.2 or higher is recommended.<br>
<i>Note: The automated install of old STAF versions (before 2.6.10) will fail with Java V1.5.&nbsp;
However, Java V1.5 should work fine once the STAF install with a lesser version of Java
is successful.&nbsp; This has not been evaluated.</i> &nbsp;We now distribute STAF version 2.6.10
so new installations with this version of STAF should have no problems using and installing
with Java 1.5.
<p>
The JRE must be in the normal search path for the system.&nbsp; The install scripts
now check this automatically.  You can check this manually using the following command typed
at any command prompt: </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java -version </p>
<p>
The command should list the version of JRE installed.&nbsp; You can download and install
a JRE if necessary from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/" >Java Sun Site</a>
</p>
<p>
You may also be able to use the JRE that is installed as part of the IBM Rational TeamTest,
IBM Rational XDE Tester or Functional Tester if the version is high enough. </p>
<p>
<h3>Install Windows Scripting Host 5.6</h3>
<p>
Windows Scripting Host 5.6 must be installed and available via the normal
system search path for the install script to run. STAF and the SAFS pieces can be installed
manually without the script, but the script can automatically error-correct important values
and set environment variables that the separate Java installs cannot. </p>
<p>
The install scripts now check this automatically.&nbsp;  You can check this manually using
the following command typed at any command prompt: </p>
<pre>    cscript
</pre>
<p>
The command should list the version of Windows Scripting Host installed.&nbsp; You can download
and install WSH 5.6 if necessary from
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/list/webdev.asp" >Microsoft Windows Script Downloads</a>
<p>
<h3>Download, UnZip/Extract, and Run the Installation Script</h3>
<p>
The RRAFS engine installation uses simple Scripting technology. It
includes everything you need to use the engine with the latest version of Robot.
Even compiled versions of all the core libraries are included. &nbsp;
You can download the installation from our
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=56751">SAFSDEV
Project FileList Page</a>. </p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Download</b> the latest RRAFS release ZIP file&nbsp; </li>
  <li><b>UnZIP/Extract</b> &quot;All Files&quot; into your Rational install directory
  "C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Rational\Rational&nbsp;Test\sqabas32"<br>
  (This is a.k.a. the DDE_RUNTIME location.) </li>
  <li>With Windows Explorer, <b>locate</b> the newly extracted "<b>SetupRRAFS.wsf</b>" script
  in that directory and double-click to launch it.</li>
  <li>Once complete, you will be prompted to proceed with the installation of
  STAF and the shared SAFS Framework.<br>
  It is recommended you select &quot;YES&quot;--even
  if you initially think you won't be using these features.<br>
  You can select &quot;NO&quot; if you wish to perform this install at a later time. </li>
</ol>
<p>
Consult <a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/SetupSAFS.README.htm"  >
SetupSAFS.README</a> to proceed with additional steps necessary to take advantage of the many
new features provided by the shared SAFS Framework. </p>
<p>
If necessary, you can instead perform a <a href="#manual_installation">manual
install</a>.&nbsp; A manual install requires extra install steps that are prone to human
error.&nbsp; Manual installs are not recommended, but not terribly difficult.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><font size="5">Further Setup is necessary for: </font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="3"><b>Rational Robot Configuration </b></font></li>
  <li><font size="3"><b>(Optional) RRAFS.INI configuration and customization </b></font>
  </li>
  <li><font size="3"><b>(Optional) Setup Development environment</b></font></li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><font size="3">Rational Robot Configuration</font></b><br>
In order to use the Rational Robot implementation of the engine there are a few
settings that should be made in Robot.&nbsp; In addition, the routines currently expect
a specific directory structure to exist in each of the projects that intend to
make use of the engine. </p>
<p>
<b>*Required* Robot Playback Option Settings:</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li>On Script Command Failure: &nbsp;Continue Execution </li>
  <li>On Verification Point Failure: &nbsp;Continue Execution </li>
  <li>Output Playback Results to Log should be enabled.<br>
  (View Log after Playback is very much optional.) </li>
  <li>On Failure to remove Unexpected Active Window: &nbsp;Continue Running </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Recommended Playback Options:</b> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The RRAFS engine has thus far proven very robust. Low settings for command
  and keystroke delays have not adversely affected playback accuracy in the
  limited number of applications that have been tested with it. Thus, you may be
  able to set Robot's playback delays extremely low (less than 10 milliseconds)
  or even to 0. These delay settings can be found in Robot's Playback Options
  dialog. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Delay between Commands (milliseconds): &nbsp;0 </li>
  <li>Delay between Keystrokes (milliseconds): &nbsp;0 </li>
  <li>Diagnostics--Timeout Delay Multiplier: &nbsp;1 </li>
  <li>Detect Unexpected Active Window:&nbsp; Disabled </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  Recommendations would be to start with no delays ( 0 milliseconds ).&nbsp; If
  your tests experience no inexplicable playback problems then you can keep
  these settings.&nbsp; However, if playback experiences problems with object clicking
  or other activities that might be attributable to Robot running too fast,
  increase the delay settings to see if that resolves the problem.&nbsp; But remember,
  there can be other causes to playback errors.&nbsp; If larger delays do not fix
  these problems, don't forget to go back and set your delays to their original
  low settings.&nbsp; This will help improve the performance of your RRAFS tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Disable Unnecessary Extensions:</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  To significantly improve performance, you should disable all unnecessary
  extensions in Robot. You do this via Robot's <b>Tools-&gt;Extension Manager</b>
  dialog. Disable all extensions you do not need. You may need to restart Robot
  for the changes to take affect. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Required Robot Project Subdirectories:</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>[Project]\Datapool\Bench</b> </li>
  <li><b>[Project]\Datapool\Dif</b> </li>
  <li><b>[Project]\Datapool\Logs</b> </li>
  <li><b>[Project]\Datapool\Runtime</b> (* OPTIONALLY REQUIRED) </li>
  <li><b>[Project]\Datapool\Test</b> </li>
  <p>
  * The Datapool\Runtime directory is used to store project-specific RRAFS.INI files and other
  project-specific items we may introduce over time.
  <p>
  Following an install, there should be <b>SetupSAFSProject.VBS</b> script in the DDE_RUNTIME
  install directory and in SAFS\bin (if installed).&nbsp; This script can be placed in a
  project's root directory, executed, and it will create the default directory structure for
  you.
  <p>
  You can also just Drag-N-Drop the files and subdirectory structure from \SAFS\Project\*.* to
  your project's root directory.  You don't copy the "SAFS\Project\" folder itself, just all
  the files and folders beneath it.
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>RRAFS.INI Configuration and Customization</h3>
<p>
The <b>RRAFS.INI</b> configuration file actually lets the user configure the
framework to use alternate locations for the Bench, Dif, Logs, and Test
directories--among other things. The <b>Datapool\Runtime</b> directory is
OPTIONAL only as long as you do not intend to place a version of the RRAFS.INI
file in that location. If you do intend to deploy a project-specific version of
RRAFS.INI, then it must be placed in the &lt;Project&gt;\Datapool\Runtime location and
that directory cannot be &quot;moved&quot; to any alternate location.</p>
<p>
By default, a &quot;global&quot; copy of the RRAFS.INI exists in the DDE_RUNTIME
directory (<i>Program Files\Rational\Rational Test\sqabas32</i>) where all the source was
installed.&nbsp; This copy affects all projects accessed by the local machine. Settings placed
in a project-specific Datapool\Runtime RRAFS.INI will override the &quot;global&quot; settings
in DDE_RUNTIME. </p>
<p>
<b>Set Windows Environment Variables</b>:</p>
<p>
The <b>RRAFS.INI</b> file and other changes have removed most
requirements for Environment Variable settings for RRAFS. However, the shared
SAFS Framework and STAF each have one Environment setting noting their root
install directories.
<p>
These root install directories are:
<ul>
<li>SAFSDIR = C:\SAFS (default)
<li>STAFDIR = C:\STAF (default)
</ul>
The instructions below provide information for backward compatibility, and some
older installations.<br>
The setup for these items must be satisfied before they can be successfully used
for older installations and installations not deploying a RRAFS.INI
configuration file.&nbsp; Environment Variable settings can be done via the Control Panel
&quot;System&quot; application.<br>
<br>
Set these as System Variables, rather than User Variables if possible. Robot
will need rebooting in order to use any new or modified setting.<br>
<ul>
  <li>A <b>DDE_RUNTIME </b>system environment variable can be set pointing to
  the directory where the DDE files(SBH,SBX, etc.) are located for RUNTIME (vs.
  Development time).&nbsp; This is no longer *required*.<br>
  Something like DDE_RUNTIME=&quot;<a href="file:///C:/Program%20Files/Rational/Rational%20Test/sqabas32">C:\Program
  Files\Rational\Rational Test\sqabas32</a>&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>File comparison differences (diffs) can be viewed with tools like
  <a href="http://www.prestosoft.com/examdiff/examdiff.htm"><strong>ExamDiff</strong></a>&nbsp;
  or <b>Gemini(SAS only)</b>. If the viewer tools are installed and the System
  PATH environment variable includes the viewer's directory in the PATH. By
  default, the DDE will reference the
  <a href="http://www.prestosoft.com/examdiff/examdiff.htm"><strong>ExamDiff</strong></a>
  <b>&nbsp;</b>tool for post-execution diff viewing. By default, the /t command
  line option for ExamDiff will be used.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You can specify a different viewer and\or different command line options
  by adding the following Environment variables with appropriate values:<br>
  <br>
  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DDE_DIFF_VIEW_EXE</b>=&lt;viewertool.exe&gt; <br>
  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DDE_DIFF_VIEW_OPTIONS</b>=&lt;alternate options or spaces
  for none&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See
  <a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/NTCommandUtilities.htm#run_difftool_exe" target="_blank">
  NTCommandUtilities</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>(DDE_DIFF...environment variables are not absolutely required. Neither is
  the installation of ExamDiff, Gemini, or any other comparison viewer.) </li>
</ul>

<b><font size="4">Setup Development Environment </font></b></p>
<p>
<b>If/How/Where to Setup and Build a RRAFS development environment:</b> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  The RRAFS release ZIP includes everything you need to use the engine with
  Robot. Even compiled versions of all the core libraries are included. &nbsp;
  If you don't intend to add new functionality, then you may not
  need to setup a development environment and you should not have to compile the
  code.
  <p>
  Of course, if Robot complains about the compiled code format when you
  attempt to execute a test then you might need to compile the source SBLs with
  your version of Robot.
  <p>
  If you are using an incompatible version of Robot, you may have to create
  a development project and compile all the libraries to work with your version.
  You will also need to create a development project if you are planning to
  develop new functionality or customizations for the engine. </p>
  <p>
  To do this, <b>Create a separate Rational project</b>. This one will be
  your *DEVELOPMENT* project--the one you will use to build the engine (and/or
  enhance it so that you can pass that on to SAFSDEV and the rest of the world :)
  <p>
  This project should not be used for anything other than building, enhancing,
  and testing the engine. It is not recommended for production testing of another
  application.
  <p>
  Next, UnZIP/Extract the RRAFS release ZIP file into the project's <b>.\TMS_Scripts\SQABas32</b>
  directory. Only the *.SBL and *.SBH files need to be extracted into this
  directory. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b><em>You must *NOT* run the &quot;SetupRRAFS.wsf&quot; script from this project directory</em></b>!
<blockquote>
  <p>
  You will then need to do a batch compile in Robot (File-&gt;Batch Compile) of
  all SQABasic library source. If you make changes that you want available to
  all projects, then those changes and the associated compiled *.SBX files
  should be moved or copied to the DDE_RUNTIME location where the Rational
  product is installed. Changes are only local to that project until they are
  copied or moved to the DDE_RUNTIME location. </p>
  <p>
  Once changes are copied or moved to your DDE_RUNTIME location, ALL projects
  accessed by this machine will find the modified files in this location. The
  modified files must also be copied (dragon drop?) to each Robot machine that
  is to run with the modifications. You only have to modify/build once on one
  machine. Then just copy to all other machines that need it. The other machines
  must have completed the initial RRAFS install and the other setup described at
  the top of this document. </p>
  <p>
  This provides a neat development advantage. All projects can use and run a
  PRODUCTION version of the engine from the DDE_RUNTIME directory. Your special
  DEVELOPMENT project can be used to play with, modify, and enhance the version
  in DEVELOPMENT without impacting the PRODUCTION version. And you don't have to
  do anything special to take advantage of this. Robot always looks for files in
  the active Project's sqabas32 directory before it goes looking in your
  DDE_RUNTIME directory. So it will find modified development files before it
  will find the production DDE_RUNTIME versions. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Note: Users who have disabled the Repository or Project SQABas32 directory
by specifying a path to a &quot;common&quot; directory will either have to temporarily
disable this setting or use that common directory to build the engine. They will
then also have to make their own determination as to whether they want to
install the engine files to each machine's DDE_RUNTIME directory, or leave it in
the &quot;common&quot; directory. I have not used this type of setup but imagine you loose
the advantages of separate DEVELOPMENT and RUNTIME environments as discussed
above.</i></p>
<hr>
<p>
<b><font size="5">Manual Installation Instructions: </font></b></p>
<p>
These instructions are for those folks who need to manually install a
release.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is generally only necessary if you do not have access
to and/or are not allowed to use Microsoft's Scripting technologies.&nbsp;
Manual installs are not recommended, but not terribly difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use
the Scripting technology whenever possible.&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.&nbsp; <b>Download </b>the latest RRAFS release ZIP file. </p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <b>UnZIP/Extract</b>&nbsp; &quot;All Files&quot; into your Rational install
directory&nbsp; C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Rational\Rational&nbsp;Test\sqabas32&nbsp; (This is a.k.a. the DDE RUNTIME location.)</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <b>Move the following files</b> from your DDE_RUNTIME directory <b>into</b>
your <b>System Folder</b>. This is often [Windows Dir]\System32.</p>
<ul><li>CWPHooker.DLL
<li>STAFWrap.DLL
<li>MSXSL.EXE
</ul>
4.&nbsp; <b>Register</b> the <b>DDVariableStore.DLL </b>extracted into your
DDE_RUNTIME directory. This is done from a command line with regsvr32:<br>
<br>
<b>regsvr32 </b>&quot;[path to DLL]\<b>DDVariableStore.DLL</b>&quot; [Enter] <br>
<p>
There is also a DDVariableStoreREGISTER.VBS script you can double-click to do this.
<p>
5.&nbsp; The following items need to be installed to take advantage of the
ever-growing XML features of the engine. However, they do not need to be
reinstalled for every release. Check with Microsoft or your system administrator
because you may have these installed already depending on the version of your
operating system. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;If necessary, download and <b>install</b> the <b>Microsoft XML</b>
    <b>Parser</b> from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml" target=_blank >Microsoft XML
    Core Support</a>.&nbsp; More than likely you don't need to do this.</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;<b>Optionally download/copy</b> Microsoft's XSL Processor (<b>MSXSL.EXE)</b>
    and <b>place it in </b>your<b> System Folder</b> directory.&nbsp; (MSXSL.EXE is
    an addon that probably does not come as part of any Microsoft operating
    system. You will only need this if you plan to execute any of our XML
    transformations for documentation or XML log reporting. An older version of
    this file is included in the DDE_RUNTIME location extracted from the RRAFS
    release ZIP file.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
