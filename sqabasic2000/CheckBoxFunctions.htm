 Function CheckboxState (winID As String, compID As String) As Integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      Tries to determine if a checkbox is checked or unchecked.  The routine
      will perform a SetContext on the winID before the attempt is made.
      Currently, this handles most generic checkboxes and HTMLCheckboxes.

 PARAMETERS:

   winID      The recognition method for the Window containing the checkbox.

   compID     The recognition method for the checkbox within the Window.

 RETURNS:

   -1 = checked
    0 = not checked
    1 = get environment error
    2 = unrecognized property status information
   +N = other SQA errors

 ERRORS:

      none

      The routine will perform a SetContext on the winID before the attempt is
      made. Currently, this handles most generic checkboxes and HTMLCheckboxes.

 PARAMETERS:

      winID   The recognition method for the Window containing the checkbox.

      compID  The recognition method for the checkbox within the Window.

      value   The value to set the chechbox state to.

<a name="checkboxcheck"></a>
   Sub CheckBoxCheck ()


 DESCRIPTION:

 DESCRIPTION:

      Tries to perform a Check on the Checkbox.  If the Checkbox does not
      have a checkmark, it will set the checkmark.  If the Checkbox already
      has a checkmark, then it should leave it alone.
      Currently, this handles most generic checkboxes and HTMLCheckboxes.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      none

 ERRORS:

      none

      AUG 06, 2002    (YWANG) Added call to SetCheckboxState to force the state

<a name="checkboxuncheck"></a>
   Sub CheckBoxUnCheck ()


 DESCRIPTION:

      Tries to UnCheck the Checkbox.  If the Checkbox does not
      have a checkmark, it will leave it alone.  If the Checkbox already
      has a checkmark, then it should uncheck (deselect) it.
      Currently, this handles most generic Checkboxes and HTMLCheckboxes.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

<a name="main"></a>
   Sub Main ()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Entry point to process a StepDriver ACTION COMMAND on a CHECKBOX.
      The routine merely reads the Global StepDriverTestInfo.testcommand and
      calls the appropriate subroutine to process it.

      If the testcommand is unrecognized it will log a WARNING_MESSAGE and
      exit with a WARNING status.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      none    -   the called subroutine has the requirements

 ERRORS:

      none
