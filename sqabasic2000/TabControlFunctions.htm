<a name="selecttabindex"></a>
   Sub SelectTabIndex ( )


 DESCRIPTION:

      Tries to perform a standard Click on a particular Tab on the TabControl.
      The Tab is selected by its index.  The user must know whether the TabControl
      is 0-based or 1-based.

      The routine will set the StepDriverTestInfo.statuscode and
      log any pass/warning/fail info using the StepDriverTestInfo.fac LogFacility.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     Content
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Numeric index of the tab to select

              T, WINDOW, TabControl, SelectTabIndex, 2

 ERRORS:

      none

<a name="tabcontrolclick"></a>
   Sub TabControlClick ( optional process )


 DESCRIPTION:

      Tries to perform a standard Click on a particular Tab on the TabControl.
      The routine will set the StepDriverTestInfo.statuscode and
      log any pass/warning/fail info using the StepDriverTestInfo.fac LogFacility.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

      This routine accepts one optional parameter, process, to accomodate unverified
      clicks.  When process=1, this indicates you did not want to verify the click.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     Content
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Case-sensitive text on the tab to identify which tab to click.
              For Sheridan SSActiveTabs the item will be treated as a reference
              to an item in the AppMap containing coordinates at which to Click.

              T, WINDOW, TabControl, ClickTab, "StatsTab"

              Special case Sheridan SSActiveTab example AppMap storage:

              [TabControl]
              StatsTab="100,12"

      The SSActiveTab "where" lookup is done with the component name of the record AND
      Field #5.  If no matching App Map reference is found the text of Field#5 will
      be used "as is".  That is, we will assume it is the "where" information itself.
      "Coords=" will be prefixed to any "where" info beginning with numeric data (x,y coords).

 ERRORS:

      none

<a name="unverifiedtabcontrolclick"></a>
   Sub UnverifiedTabControlClick ()


 DESCRIPTION:

      Tries to perform an unverified Click on a particular Tab on the TabControl.
      The routine will set the StepDriverTestInfo.statuscode and
      log any pass/warning/fail info using the StepDriverTestInfo.fac LogFacility.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     Content
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Case-sensitive text on the tab to identify which tab to click.
              For Sheridan SSActiveTabs the item will be treated as a reference
              to an item in the AppMap containing coordinates at which to Click.

              T, WINDOW, TabControl, UnverifiedClick, "StatsTab"

              Special case Sheridan SSActiveTab example AppMap storage:

              [TabControl]

<a name="selecttabtext"></a>
   Function SelectTabText ()


 DESCRIPTION:

      Tries to perform a standard Click on a particular Tab on the TabControl.
      The routine will set the StepDriverTestInfo.statuscode and
      log any pass/warning/fail info using the StepDriverTestInfo.fac LogFacility.

      If the provided text value contains ampersands (for hotkey characters) then
      ampersands will be retained in the TabControl text for comparisons performed
      to identify the correct tab to click.
      Otherwise, ampersands are stripped out of the TabControl text to facilitate
      these comparisons.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

      The command tries to identify the correct tab in a manner different than the other
      commands.  Try this command when the normal CLICK command does not seem to work.
      Note: This command will attempt to call the default CLICK command if it cannot
      acquire all of the component properties it needs for success.  So it may
      ALWAYS be the command that is the best first try.  However, it does not currently
      perform selection validation AFTER the selection has occurred.  (This validation
      will occur, though, if the default CLICK processing is invoked.)


 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     Content
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Case-sensitive text on the tab to identify which tab to click.

 ERRORS:

      none

<a name="main"></a>
   Sub Main ()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Entry point to process a StepDriver ACTION COMMAND on a TABCONTROL.
      The routine merely reads the Global StepDriverTestInfo.testcommand and
      calls the appropriate subroutine to process it.

      If the testcommand is unrecognized it will log a WARNING_MESSAGE and
      exit with a WARNING status.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      none    -   the called subroutine has the requirements

 ERRORS:

      none
