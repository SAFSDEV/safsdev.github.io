<a name="combolistboxselect"></a>
   Sub ComboListBoxSelect ()


 DESCRIPTION:

      Select an item by its text value from an exposed combobox dropdown list.
      This method requires that the list already be exposed via a ComboBox
      Click command.  To combine both the Click and the Selection in a single
      command use the ComboBox Select command.

      We first test to make sure the item to select is actually in the list.
      If it is not, we report the failure and issue an ESCAPE character to
      close the list.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      5   Field 5 should contain the case-sensitive text item to select.
          You can enclose this text in double-quotes to ensure proper retrieval.

 ERRORS:

      none

<a name="combolistboxselectindex"></a>
   Sub ComboListBoxSelectIndex ()


 DESCRIPTION:

      Select an item by its index (0-based) from an exposed combobox dropdown
      list. This method requires that the list already be exposed (e.g. via a
      ComboBox Click command).

      We first test to make sure the index of the item to select is not out
      of bound. If it is, we report the failure and issue an ESCAPE character
      to close the list.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

      This command can be used when list item text can not be identified by Robot,
      in which case ComboListBox Select will not work.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      5   Field 5 should contain the index of the item to select.

 ERRORS:

      none

<a name="main"></a>
   Sub Main ()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Entry point to process StepDriver ACTION COMMANDS on this object.
      The routine merely reads the Global StepDriverTestInfo.testcommand and
      calls the appropriate subroutine to process it.

      If the testcommand is unrecognized it will log a WARNING_MESSAGE and
      exit with a WARNING status.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      none    -   the called subroutine has the requirements

 ERRORS:

      none
