             Verify the current contents of a binary (image, PDF etc.) file with a benchmark file.<br>
             Typically, benchmarks are stored in the Datapool\Bench directory.  
             Typically, files to test are stored in the Datapool\Test directory.  
             In that event, the filename.ext is needed for both files.<br>
             The Window and Component objects are not validated and have no role.
             The Window and Component strings can be any text, but they cannot be blank.
             <p>
             If the files are image, a diff image will be created if there are considered different.
             If the files are PDF, they will be converted to image files and then compared as image file. Each PDF page
             will be converted to an image, so comparison of 2 PDF files might be comparison of 2 set of image files.
             </p>
<p>
             The command may produce a WARNING if a diff tool for which we 
             have no means to verify the results is configured for use.  
             Consequently, if these warnings are expected, the user can use the 
             "TW" test record type to avoid issuing these warnings.</p></detailed_desc><BR/>
