 MODULE DESCRIPTION:

      Routines and utilities to work on SQA Type=JAVAMENU Java Swing JMenu objects in
      Data-Driven Automation.

      "SelectMenuItem" should work on both JavaMenus and JavaPopupMenus.
      "SelectMenuItemContains" will only work on normal JavaMenus.

   Sub PerformAction (Optional mode)


 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to select a menuitem according to its text value.
      Parent-child relationships are separated with "->"

      "SelectMenuItem" should work on both JavaMenus and JavaPopupMenus.
      "SelectMenuItemContains" will only work on JavaMenus.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Case-sensitive text of item to select
              Parent-child relationships are separated with "->"
              Example: "File->Exit"

              Alternatively, this can be an App Map key used in conjunction
              with the component Name in Field #3 to allow us to store menuitem
              text in the App Map for lookup (and easier maintenance).

              Sample with App Map key reference:
              ==================================
              T, Window, AJMenu, SelectMenuItem, "FileOpen"

              App Map Sample:
              ===============
              [AJMenu]
              FileOpen="File->Open"       OR
              FileOpen="Path=File->Open"  OR
              FileOpen="f->open"          (ex: for ...MenuItemContains partial matches)


              For ...MenuItemContains command(s):
              ------------------------------
              The "Contains" version of the command will not work on Popup menus.

              TextValue can be the case-insensitive text of the menuitem.
              For each level, a text comparison is performed. If the item
              contains the requested substring anywhere in its text, then
              that item is considered a match.
              Example: "f->x"  will successfully identify the item
                       "File->Exit"


              It should be noted that SQABasic allows the item text to be
              part of the recognition string of the menuitem.  Thus, if
              the user uses a fully qualified recognition string to the
              item, then field #5 becomes optional.  In fact, any value
              entered for field #5 will be appended to any ;PATH= recognition
              string in order to fully qualify the path to the item.

              While having the menuitem text appear in the recognition path and
              not using field #5 is possible, that may not be compatible with
              other engines using different toolsets.  For the best chance of
              multi-engine compatibility, use field #5 for providing the item
              hierarchy separate from the menu recognition string.

 ERRORS:

      none

   Sub Main ()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Entry point to process a StepDriver ACTION COMMAND on a JAVAMENU.
      The routine merely reads the Global StepDriverTestInfo.testcommand and
      calls the appropriate subroutine to process it.

      If the testcommand is unrecognized it will log a WARNING_MESSAGE and
      exit with a WARNING status.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      none    -   the called subroutine has the requirements

 ERRORS:

      none
