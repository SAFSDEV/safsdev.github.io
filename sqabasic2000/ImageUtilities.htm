 MODULE DESCRIPTION:

 Utilities for working with images and screen coordinates in SQA Robot.

 Currently, the image capture mechanism requires the use of rtcmpi.exe--which
 is installed with TeamTest and other Testing bundles of Rational Software.

 However, the installation of only the Robot testing Agent does not install
 the needed tools for the capture and export mechanism used.  So this will
 not work if ONLY the Agent is installed.

 Image capture may also fail if the user has turned off logging
 to TestManager via the Robot Tools setting.  You may have to enable
 TestManager logging for the capture to successfully execute.

 Function <a href="#createimagediff">CreateImageDiff</a> also needs the installation of ImageMagick to succeed.

 See <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org" target="magick">ImageMagick</a> and the <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/compare.php" target="magick">ImageMagick compare tool doc</a> for extra info.

      A rectangle is valid if and only if:
      rect.left < rect.right AND rect.top < rect.bottom

 PARAMETERS:

      rect    SQARectangle to be checked.

 RETURNS:

      -1 (True)   if rect is a valid rectangle specification.
       0 (False)  if rect is not a valid rectangle specification.

 ERRORS:

      (none)

<a name="validatecontainedrectangle"></a>
  function ValidateContainedRectangle( _
      containedRect as SQARectangle, _
      containerRect as SQARectangle ) as integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      Validate coordinates of a rectangle contained in another rectangle.
      If the coordinates of the contained rect are outside the range of the
      container rect, they are changed to the nearest boundary values so that
      the new coords of the contained rect are fully within the container
      rect.

 PARAMETERS:

      containedRect   Coords of the contained rectangle. Might be forced to
                      the boundary value of containerRect.
      containerRect   Coords of the container rectangle.

 RETURNS:

      -1 (True)   if containedRect is validated/fitted with containerRect.
       0 (False)  if either rect is an invalid rectangle specification.
                  containedRect will not be changed in this case.

 ERRORS:

      (none)

<a name="getrectanglefromstring"></a>
  Function GetRectangleFromString( _
      rectStr As String, _
      rect As SQARectangle ) as integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      Convert a string expression to a rectangle.

 PARAMETERS:

      rectStr String expression that represents a rectangle. The format must
              be stricly "x1,y1 to x2,y2", where (x1,y1) is the top-left of
              the rectangle and (x2,y2) is the bottom-right. This is the
              format of the ScreenRect and ClientRect properties that can be
              retrieved via SQAGetProperyAsString().
      rect    SQARectangle that receives coordinates converted from recStr.

 RETURNS:

      -1 (True)   on successful converstion. The converted rect must also pass
                  the validation by IsValidRectangle.
       0 (False)  on failure or any error (e.g. invalid rectStr, invalid rect).

 ERRORS:

      (none)

<a name="getmaskfromstring"></a>
  Function GetMaskFromString( _
      rWidth As integer, _
      rHeight As integer, _
      maskStr As String, _
      rect as SQARectangle ) as integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      Convert a string expression to a mask.
      A mask is a rectangle contained within a container rectangle. The
      coordinates of the mask is relative to that of the container rectangle.
      That means the coords of the mask are always in the range of
      (0,0,width,height).

 PARAMETERS:

      rWidth  Width of the container rectangle of the mask.
      rHeight Height of the container rectangel of the mask.
      maskStr String expression that specifies a mask area of a rectangle.
              The expression can contain either absolute coordinates or
              percentages ("x1,y1,x2,y2" or "x1%,y1%,x2%,y2%"). Note that the
              size of the container rectangle implies the boundary value of
              this parameter, i.e. (0,0) and (0%,0%) are the minimum, and
              (width, height) and (100%,100%) are the maximum. Values
              exceeding the minimun/maximum are forced to the nearest boundary
              value. Absolute and percent values can be mixed, e.g.
              "0,0,50%,50%" is valid.
      rect    SQARectangle that receives the mask coordinates with respect to
              the container rectangle.

 EXAMPLES:

      rWidth  rHeight     maskString          rect (left, top, right, bottom)

 RETURNS:

      -1 (True)   on successful converstion. The converted rect must also pass
                  the validation by IsValidRectangle.
       0 (False)  on failure or any error (e.g. invalid maskStr).

<a name="capturescreenshottovpimg"></a>
  function CaptureScreenShotToVPImg( rect as SQARectangle ) as string

 DESCRIPTION:

      Capture screen shot of a rectangular area to a .img file.
      RegionVP function is called with the specified coordinates. This
      generates a .img file in the "vp" directory of the runtime log folder
      which is obtained with SQAGetLogDir.

      Note that if the specified area exceeds the boundary of the screen,
      only the portion that is displayed on the screen will be captured. If
      the specified area is completely outside the screen, the fucntion will
      no capture nothing and return "".

      NOTE: We use Robot's Image Comparator tool to capture the screenshot.
      The routine may fail to execute properly if the user has turned off logging
      to TestManager via the Robot Tools setting.  You may have to enable
      TestManager logging for the routine to successfully execute.

 PARAMETERS:

      rect    SQARectangle that represents the specified area.

 RETURNS:

      Full path to the .img file. "" if failed (e.g. rect out-of-bound).

 ERRORS:

      (none)

<a name="createimagediff"></a>
  Function CreateImageDiff( bench as string, actual as string, diff as String ) as Integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      Create a new image that graphically shows the differences between the
      supplied bench and actual.

      Currently, this function only supports the use of the ImageMagick 'compare'
      tool.  ImageMagick must be installed for this function to succeed.

      Future releases may allow for alternate tool support.

      See <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org" target="magick">ImageMagick</a> and the <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/compare.php" target="magick">ImageMagick compare tool doc</a> for extra info.

 PARAMETERS:

      bench   the full path to the benchmark image to use in the compare image creation.
      actual  the full path to the test 'actual' image to use in the compare image creation.
      diff    the full path to the output diff image to be created.

 RETURNS:

      -1    on success
       0    bench or actual do not exist
       1    Required Tool support not installed or available (ImageMagick)
       2    failure in Shell execution
       3    Shell execution did not complete (still running?)
       4    compared image sizes do not match (diff may not be generated)


 ERRORS:

      (none)
