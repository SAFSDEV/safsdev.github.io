   Sub ScrollBarPageRight ()


 DESCRIPTION:

      Tries to perform a ScrollPageRight on a scrollbar.  The input record
      can optionally specify the number of iterations to perform the action.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      (5) Optional integer to specify how many times to perform the action.

 ERRORS:

      none

<a name="main"></a>
   Sub Main ()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Entry point to process a StepDriver ACTION COMMAND on a SCROLLBAR.
      The routine merely reads the Global StepDriverTestInfo.testcommand and
      calls the appropriate subroutine to process it.

      If the testcommand is unrecognized it will log a WARNING_MESSAGE and
      exit with a WARNING status.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      none    -   the called subroutine has the requirements

 ERRORS:

      none
