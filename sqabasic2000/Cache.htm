 MODULE DESCRIPTION:

      Description.


      Cache TABLES FORMAT:


      NOTE:
               ****       ****        ****        ****        ****
      SQARobot must be configured to "Continue Execution" upon Script Command
      Failures in order for this to work properly.  Where appropriate we set
      flags and status to recognize, report, and work with these failures.
               ****       ****        ****        ****        ****

 To actually make use of the library in another module the developer needs
 to $Include this header file and these additional files:

      LogUtilities_X.SBH              (Constants, Globals, Types etc.)
      ApplicationUtilities_X.SBH      (Constants, Globals, Types etc.)
      Cache_X.SBH                     (Constants, Globals, Types etc.)

<a name="cachegetlineinput"></a>
  Function CacheGetLineInput(fileref As Integer, info As AUStatusInfo, byref linein as string) As String

 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine returns the next line from the fileref provided
      and increments the <a href="#globals">AUStatusInfo.linecount</a> counter.
      The routine returns the line--which is a result of a Line Input #fileref
      statement--unmodified.

      All Driver routines which input records from a cached data table will
      call this routine. Users would not normally call this routine directly.


 PARAMETERS:

      fileref     Integer from file's OPEN statement.
      info        AUStatusInfo structure

 RESULTS:

      String  returned from Line Input statement unmodified.

 ERRORS:

      none

  Function CacheInit(cdfac As LogFacility, stfac As LogFacility, sdfac As LogFacility) As Integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to initialize the cache information.


 PARAMETERS:

      cdfac As Cycle Driver LogFacility
      stfac As Suite DriverLogFacility
      sdfac As Step DriverLogFacility

 RESULTS:

      none

 ERRORS:

<a name="loadcache"></a>
  Function LoadCache(fileref As Integer, info As AUStatusInfo) As Integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to read data from the table and fill in the cache information.


 PARAMETERS:

      fileref     open file reference to file that needs to be cached.

 RESULTS:

      Indication whether or not loading the cache was successful. If good,
      CurrentCM is set to point to the CM table entries that point to the
      correct cache entry.

 ERRORS:

      none
