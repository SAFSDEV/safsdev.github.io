<pre>
 MODULE DESCRIPTION:

  This tool provides a GUI front-end to the <a href="SQAPublisher.htm">SQAPublisher</a> tool.
  It allows us to publish HTML documentation from properly formatted in-context
  source code comments.

  FILE TYPE:
  This lets us know whether the
  file to publish is a Script or
  a Library.  Robot stores these
  different file types in
  different directories.  The
  source directory field will
  update appropriately with this
  selection.

  SOURCE BASENAME:
  The short name of the file to
  publish.  This must not contain
  the path or file extension
  because the publisher needs to
  be able to apply different
  extensions for headers, scripts,
  and library files during the course of its operation.


  SOURCE DIRECTORY:
  The location where the publisher can expect to find the source files to publish.
  Normally this is set properly based upon the FILE TYPE selection.  You should
  not have to change this value unless you are trying to publish files located in
  a different Robot project or outside of the current repository.

  OUTPUT DIRECTORY:
  The location where the output HTML should be placed.  By default, a Doc
  subdirectory in the Library folder of the current repository is used.

  RUNTIME DIRECTORY:
  Publication normally occurs locally.  It generally expects all files needed for
  publishing to be local (the headers and source for the file to be published).
  However, the tool was originally meant to publish doc for scripts and libraries
  that were shared in a public non-local repository.  Thus, the documentation
  needs to specify where it is that the headers and executables will actually be
  located at production runtime.  Specify this location in this field.
  IF THE RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT IS LOCAL TO THE PROJECT OR THE ROBOT INSTALLATION
  THEN NO PATH INFORMATION SHOULD BE SPECIFIED.  THE FIELD CAN BE BLANK.

  The public repository runtime directory is specified in the DDE_RUNTIME
  environment variable.

      &lt;\\Machine\RuntimeRepo&gt;

  COPYRIGHT FILE:
  The full path and name to an optional file that contains complete copyright
  text to append to the output HTML.  This text will be appended to the
  output file unmodified.

  PUBLISHING:
  Shows the path and filename of the output that will be created based on the
  current settings of the Dialog Box.

  OK BUTTON:
  Once all settings are acceptable, press OK to publish the doc.
  <a href="SQAPublisher.htm">SQAPublisher</a> will be invoked with these settings.  Once
  completed (and if successful) the default web browser will be launched showing
  the newly created file.  After a short pause, the dialog will reappear allowing
  you to publish another doc.

  CANCEL BUTTON:
  Exits the dialog box and returns to normal Robot activities.

  HELP BUTTON:
  Launches the default web browser with this documentation.  The documentation is
  expected to be found in the location specified by the DDE_RUNTIME environment
  variable.  By default the doc is Publish.htm
