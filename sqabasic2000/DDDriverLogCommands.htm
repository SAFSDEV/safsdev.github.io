 MODULE DESCRIPTION:

 The documentation for each function is provided as reference for DDE users
 when developing DDE test tables.  This DDE format and syntax information IS
 intended for public use and does not normally change with the underlying code.

 The routines themselves are not intended for public use.
 Their internal functionality and their declaration prototypes
 are subject to change as deemed necessary to support the drivers
 mentioned above.

  Function DDEDriverLogCommand(DriverCMD As String, guiInfo As AUGUIInfo, statusInfo As AUStatusInfo) As Integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      Processes a DDE DRIVER COMMAND from the AUGUIInfo.InputRecord provided.
      Driver commands are not treated as test commands but instructions to
      the Drivers for setting parameters of the test environment, running
      other scripts, or other stuff (whatever gets in here).

      Different driver commands have different parameters as described below.
      For reference, the first fields are defined below:

      Field #1:   The "C" = DRIVER COMMAND.
      Field #2:   The Driver Command to execute. (see definitions below).

      Example:

          c , SetApplicationMap , "AppMap.map"


      Parameters must be placed in the order specified.
      Parameters numbered in brackets are optional.
      However, to use an optional parameter which follows other optional
      parameters all the preceding parameters must exist or at least have
      field delimited space reserved for them.

      This DDEDriver Command routine is not intended for public use.
      Internal functionality and declaration prototypes
      are subject to change as deemed necessary to support the core drivers.


 PARAMETERS:

      DriverCMD       from the calling DDDriverCommands library.
      AUGUIInfo       from the calling Driver
      AUStatusInfo    from the calling Driver

 RETURNS:

      Normally DDU_NO_SCRIPT_FAILURE unless something unforeseen causes the

      Returns DDU_SCRIPT_NOT_EXECUTED if no matching driver command was found.

 ERRORS:

       none
