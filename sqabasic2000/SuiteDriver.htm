 MODULE DESCRIPTION:

      Application-independent driver for data driven automation with SQA.
      Used in conjunction with <a href="CycleDriver.htm">CycleDriver</a> and <a href="StepDriver.htm">StepDriver</a>.
      The three driver routines form the primary data-driven engine for test
      automation.

      <a href="StepDriver.htm">StepDriver</a> is the primary GUI driver, exercising the AUT and verifying
      AUT status and data via lists or tables of user-defined instructions.
      The format of these instructions is easy to understand, is AUT
      independent, is automation tool independent, and can be used as scripts
      for manual testing.  They are generally very short, performing only
      a few simple steps to drive, test, or verify a small piece of a particular
      application state or function.  For example, one table may verify the text
      of a set of controls or window.  Another may check that particular
      menuitems are present and in the proper state.  Another may activate a
      particular control and ensure the AUT responded accordingly.

      SuiteDriver is the mid-level driver whose data tables are generally
      user-defined lists of StepDriver tables.  Here the simple StepDriver tables
      are linked together to form more complex sets of tests.  Each Suite might
      test an entire area of functionality for a given AUT.
      For example, there may be a Suite to test the entire Reports section of an
      app, another to fully test Data entry.

      <a href="CycleDriver.htm">CycleDriver</a> is the highest level driver whose
      data-tables are generally lists of Suites to provide the SuiteDriver.  Thus
      this defines the total test for the AUT through the data-driven engine.
      Since CycleDriver is the highest level of data-driven automation, it is generally
      invoked by a Robot Script which has been setup to perform a particular Test
      Cycle.  For example, there may be an Integration Test Cycle, a Systems Test Cycle,
      a Build Verification Cycle, a Regression Test Cycle, as well as versions of these
      for different versions of the AUT.


      DATA TABLE FORMAT:

          Each command line or record in the provided filename represents the
          start of a new record/command/entry.

          It is possible for a single command to use multiple lines if its syntax
          or implementation provides that capability.  This routine, at this time,
          expects the information it needs to reside on the current command line.

          Blank Lines are ignored.

          For each valid record:

          Field #1:   Represents one of our <a href="#recordtypes">RECORD TYPES</a>.
          Remaining Fields (2-N) are interpreted based on the RECORD TYPE.
          Consult the various routines of this driver to determine the format
          and number of fields needed for each RECORD TYPE.

          If Field #1 is empty, the entire record is skipped.

          If Field #1 contains an entry other than a known record type, we
          will assume it is the name of a runnable Robot script and will attempt
          to execute it.  This is called IMPLIED SCRIPT EXECUTION.

          Comment Lines begin with a comment delimiter(s) RECORD TYPE.
          (Generally, ['] and [;] will be treated as comment lines as well as
           and record whose first field is empty.)

          All fields not containing variables (see below) within a record can
          be enclosed in quotation marks to help visually delimit field.

          Valid record fields can be used to set and receive variable values
          that can be used for the current table and any subsequent tables.
          Where a field is used to set a value it is also immediately replaced
          by that value for immediate use.  Variables are references by immediately
          preceding their names with a caret (^).  The symbol must be the first
          non-whitespace character in the field. Variable references cannot reside
          inside of quotation marks or they will be left as literal strings.

          It is important to note that a field that is replaced by a variable's
          value will be enclosed in quotes.

          See <a href="DDVariableStore.htm">DDVariableStore</a> for more information on the use of variables in
          these data tables.  Specifically, <a href="DDVariableStore.htm#DDVSubstituteVariables">DDVSubstituteVariables</a> and
          <a href="DDVariableStore.htm#DDVExtractVariables">DDVExtractVariables</a>.


      SAMPLE DATA TABLE:

      ' Data Table Sample
      ' Some Record Types:
      ' B = Define a Named Block within the file
      ' C = Driver Command
      ' S = SKIP this Record
      ' T = Perform a ComponentFunction action or test

      c_ Version "1.0"
      c_ SetApplicationMap_ "AppMap.map"
      c_   WaitForGUI     _ LoginWindow_ LoginWindow_ 30

      ' Do some Data Driven Login tests here....
      t_ Login _ "," _ ^userid = "MyUserID" _ ^password = "MyPassword"
      t_ VerifyLogin _ ","


      A user or developer would normally only call the <a href="#stsuitedriver">STSuiteDriver</a>
      routine.  This is the entry point used by <a href="CycleDriver.htm">CycleDriver</a> to
      perform data-driven automation.  All other routines are called by the <a href="#stsuitedriver">STSuiteDriver</a>
      routine as required.
      (Some multi-line test commands may eventually call <a href="#stgetlineinput">STGetLineInput</a>.)

      NOTE:
               ****       ****        ****        ****        ****
      SQARobot must be configured to "Continue Execution" upon Script Command
      Failures in order for this to work properly.  Where appropriate we set
      flags and status to recognize, report, and work with these failures.

<a name="stprocesstestrecord"></a>
  Function STProcessTestRecord (stepFac As LogFacility) As Integer

 DESCRIPTION:

      At this point the Driver has determined we are dealing with a Test Record.
      A Test Record is one containing a data table filename for StepDriver to execute.

      Field #1:   The TEST record type (T).

      Subsequent fields would be as follows (with a separator between each field):

      Field:  #2                 #3
      ================      =============
      StepDataFilename        Separator

      FILENAME:   A filename or path suitable for the <a href="StepDriver.htm#sdstepdriver">StepDriver.SDStepDriver</a> routine.
                  (No error checking is done here.  It is done in StepDriver.)

      SEPARATOR:  (Optional)  Character(s) to use as the field separator for
                  specified file.  Normally, you would only specify this if the
                  separator is different than the one currently in use.
                  The default is to use the one currently in use by SuiteDriver.

      NOTE:
      A user or developer would not normally call this routine.  This
      routine is intended to be called from the STSuiteDriver routine as
      deemed necessary by the input records of the data table provided to
      the STSuiteDriver routine.

 PARAMETERS:

      stepFac     LogFacility to log StepDriver messages to.

 RETURNS:

      STGeneralScriptFailure if we were unable to call StepDriver
                             (generally, a missing table filename)

      STNoScriptFailure      if we DID call StepDriver
                             (StepDriver failures CAN have occurred, however)

 ERRORS:

       none

<a name="stsuitedriver"></a>
  Sub STSuiteDriver (filename As String, separator As String,
                     fac As LogFacility, stepFac As LogFacility, Optional mode)

 DESCRIPTION:

      This is the routine that the CycleDriver or other user utility should
      call within this library.  All the other routines are called from this
      routine based upon the input records of the provided data table.

      DATA TABLE FORMAT:

          Each command line or record in the provided filename represents the
          start of a new record/command/entry.
          It is possible for a single command to use multiple lines if its syntax
          or implementation provides that capability.  This routine, at this time,
          expects the information it needs (only the record type) to reside on the
          current command line.

          Blank Lines are ignored.

          For each valid record:
          Field #1:   Represents one of the driver <a href="#recordtypes">RECORD TYPES</a>.
          Remaining Fields (2-N) are interpreted based on the RECORD TYPE.
          Consult the various routines of this driver and <a href="DDDriverCommands.htm">DDDriverCommands</a> to
          determine the format and number of fields needed for each RECORD TYPE.

          If Field #1 is empty, then the entire record is skipped.

          If Field #1 is an unrecognized record type, the Driver will attempt to
          execute it as a Script.  In that case, subsequent fields in the input
          record can contain any parameters or DDVariables the script might want or need.
          See <a href="UsingDDVariables.htm">Using DDVariables</a> for more information on this nifty capability!

          Comment Lines begin with a comment delimiter RECORD TYPE--a single quote (').
          Lines whose first non-blank character is a semicolon (;) are also ignored.

      The routine does not have a return value since it is a subroutine.
      However, upon exit, the <a href="#globals">GLOBAL</a> SuiteDriverInfo will contain all the status
      information available on the results of the call.

 PARAMETERS:

      filename    String filename to the data table to use as input.
                  The routine tries to locate the file as if it were a full path.
                  If it doesn't find it then it attempts to locate the file
                  relative to the repository, the project, the project\datapool.

      separator   field separator string to isolate fields within each
                  data table record.
                  If not provided(""), uses last defined separator.
                  If none ever provided then uses a comma (,).

      fac         LogFacility to use for SuiteDriver logging.

      stepFac     LogFacility to use for StepDriver logging.

      mode        Optional parameter specifying in what mode SuiteDriver should
                  be running.  By default, SuiteDriver runs in StandAlone mode
                  and outputs additional test information for each
                  data table it processes.  In a Cycle Driven mode this additional
                  information may not be desirable.
                  See <a href="#modes">Suite Driver Modes</a> in the CONSTANTS section
                  for valid SuiteDriver modes.

 ERRORS:

       none

      The routine returns the line--which is a result of a Line Input #fileref
      statement--unmodified.

      All routines which input records from the SuiteDriver data table should
      call this routine for their line input in order to maintain an accurate
      linecount.


 PARAMETERS:

      fileref     Integer from file's OPEN statement.

 RESULTS:

      String  returned from Line Input statement unmodified.

 ERRORS:
