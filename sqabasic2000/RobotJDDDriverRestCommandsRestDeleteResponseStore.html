                    Delete ALL REST responses (and requests if stored) from the persistent storages. 
                    The REST response/request is supposed to be in the persistent storages.
                    The response/request can be in more than one type of persistence storage, and
                    it can be a series of variables, a file or something else, please refer to 
                    explanation of parameters of keyword <a href="#detail_RestStoreResponse"><b>RestStoreResponse</b></a>.
                    For example, if there are 2 Responses/Requests have been persisted, 
                    one is stored be in a XML file, a JSON file and "a series of variables" at the same time,
                    the other is stored in JSON file and "a series of variables", then this keyword will delete 
                    all of them (XML file, JSON file and variables of the first Response/Request, 
                    JSON file and "a series of variables" of the second Response/Request).
