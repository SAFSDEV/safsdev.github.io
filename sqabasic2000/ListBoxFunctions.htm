   Sub VerifySelectedItem (Optional match, Optional unselected)


 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to verify a particular text item is selected.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Case-sensitive text of node to verify as selected.

 INTERNAL USE SUBROUTINE PARAMETERS (subject to change at a whim):

      match       Optional parameter to enable partial matches (match=1).
                  This is for the PartialMatch set of commands.

      unselected  Optional parameter to test that an item is NOT selected (unselected=1).
                  This is for the Unselected set of commands.

   Sub SelectUnverifiedTextItem



 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to Click an item according to its text value.
      No check is performed after the selection to verify success.

      in nature and disappears immediately upon a selection.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.
