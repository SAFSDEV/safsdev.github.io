   Sub SetTextValue ()



 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to set the text of the editbox.  This version allows the use
      of special character combinations and substrings to identify specific
      keyboard keys.  These are the same special characters and interpretation
      used for Robot's InputKeys command and the Windows Scripting Host.

      ~^+%{( are primarily the characters that induce special processing.

      The routine verifies we can read the text property, sets the text value
      and will verify that the property has been set to that value *IF* none
      of the special characters exist in the provided text value.  If those
      special characters exist, then no post-set verification will occur.
      Also, no post-set verification occurs for any "Unverified" command.

      If you do not want to have any characters converted or interpretted as
      special characters then you need to use the SetTextCharacters command.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 PARAMETERS:

      mode    0 -- verify the EditBox text value after setting it.

      mode    1 -- bypass verifying the entered text value.


 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      FLD     CONTENT
      ---     ------------------------------
       5      Text to send to editbox.  Quoted text may be used to ensure proper
              expected value retrieval.
              There is also no check for a missing field because that would be
              the same as specifying no text ("")--which is valid.

 ERRORS:

      none

   Sub SetTextCharacters (Optional mode)


 DESCRIPTION:

      Routine to set the text of the editbox.
      It verifies we can read the property, sets the text value and then
      verifies that the property has been set to that value.
      This routine uses only the literal text provided.  It does not attempt
      to convert or interpret the text provided as special characters.  To
      do that, see the SetTextValue command.

      The routine expects that the given object already has Context or Focus.
      It also expects that Global StepDriverTestInfo contains all the information
      it needs to perform its function.

 PARAMETERS:

      mode    0 -- verify the EditBox text value after setting it.

      mode    1 -- bypass verifying the entered text value.

   Sub Main ()

 DESCRIPTION:

      Entry point to process a StepDriver ACTION COMMAND on a EDITBOX.
      The routine merely reads the Global StepDriverTestInfo.testcommand and
      calls the appropriate subroutine to process it.

      If the testcommand is unrecognized it will log a WARNING_MESSAGE and
      exit with a WARNING status.

 DATA TABLE PARAMETERS:

      none    -   the called subroutine has the requirements

 ERRORS:

      none
